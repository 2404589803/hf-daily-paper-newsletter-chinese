Leveraging LLMs as critique models to achieve automated supervision is\na promising solution. In this work, we focus on studying and enhancing the math\ncritique ability of LLMs. Current LLM critics provide critiques that are too\nshallow and superficial on each step, leading to low judgment accuracy and\nstruggling to offer sufficient feedback for the LLM generator to correct\nmistakes. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel and effective two-stage\nframework to develop LLM critics that are capable of deliberately critiquing on\neach reasoning step of math solutions. In the first stage, we utilize\nQwen2.5-72B-Instruct to generate 4.5K long-form critiques as seed data for\nsupervised fine-tuning. Each seed critique consists of deliberate step-wise\ncritiques that includes multi-perspective verifications as well as in-depth\ncritiques of initial critiques for each reasoning step. Then, we perform\nreinforcement learning on the fine-tuned model with either existing\nhuman-labeled data from PRM800K or our automatically annotated data obtained\nvia Monte Carlo sampling-based correctness estimation, to further incentivize\nits critique ability. Our developed critique model built on Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct\nnot only significantly outperforms existing LLM critics (including the\nsame-sized DeepSeek-R1-distill models and GPT-4o) on various error\nidentification benchmarks, but also more effectively helps the LLM generator\nrefine erroneous steps through more detailed feedback.",

In this paper, we define IGV as a technology that\ncombines generative capabilities to produce diverse high-quality video content\nwith interactive features that enable user engagement through control signals\nand responsive feedback. We survey the current landscape of IGV applications,\nfocusing on three major domains: 1) gaming, where IGV enables infinite\nexploration in virtual worlds; 2) embodied AI, where IGV serves as a\nphysics-aware environment synthesizer for training agents in multimodal\ninteraction with dynamically evolving scenes; and 3) autonomous driving, where\nIGV provides closed-loop simulation capabilities for safety-critical testing\nand validation. To guide future development, we propose a comprehensive\nframework that decomposes an ideal IGV system into five essential modules:\nGeneration, Control, Memory, Dynamics, and Intelligence. Furthermore, we\nsystematically analyze the technical challenges and future directions in\nrealizing each component for an ideal IGV system, such as achieving real-time\ngeneration, enabling open-domain control, maintaining long-term coherence,\nsimulating accurate physics, and integrating causal reasoning. We believe that\nthis systematic analysis will facilitate future research and development in the\nfield of IGV, ultimately advancing the technology toward more sophisticated and\npractical applications.",

      "summary": "Recently, long-thought reasoning models achieve strong performance on complex\nreasoning tasks, but often incur substantial inference overhead, making\nefficiency a critical concern. Our empirical analysis reveals that the benefit\nof using Long-CoT varies across problems: while some problems require elaborate\nreasoning, others show no improvement, or even degraded accuracy. This\nmotivates adaptive reasoning strategies that tailor reasoning depth to the\ninput. However, prior work primarily reduces redundancy within long reasoning\npaths, limiting exploration of more efficient strategies beyond the Long-CoT\nparadigm. To address this, we propose a novel two-stage framework for adaptive\nand efficient reasoning. First, we construct a hybrid reasoning model by\nmerging long and short CoT models to enable diverse reasoning styles. Second,\nwe apply bi-level preference training to guide the model to select suitable\nreasoning styles (group-level), and prefer concise and correct reasoning within\neach style group (instance-level). Experiments demonstrate that our method\nsignificantly reduces inference costs compared to other baseline approaches,\nwhile maintaining performance. Notably, on five mathematical datasets, the\naverage length of reasoning is reduced by more than 50%, highlighting the\npotential of adaptive strategies to optimize reasoning efficiency in large\nlanguage models.
