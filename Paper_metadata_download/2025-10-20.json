We introduce a curation and synthesis pipeline that\ngenerates 24M single-modal and omni-modal conversations. We find that\nmodalities reinforce one another in both perception and reasoning.

The challenges lie in the lack of large-scale and high-quality\nreal-world 3D scans for training generalizable generative models. In this\npaper, we take an alternative route to create large-scale 3D scenes by\nsynergizing the readily available satellite imagery that supplies realistic\ncoarse geometry and the open-domain diffusion model for creating high-quality\nclose-up appearances.

We tailor a curriculum-driven iterative\nrefinement strategy to progressively enhance geometric completeness and\nphotorealistic textures.

Additionally, MorphoBench\nadaptively modifies the analytical challenge of questions by leveraging key\nstatements generated during the model's reasoning process. Furthermore, it\nincludes questions generated using simulation software, enabling dynamic\nadjustment of benchmark difficulty with minimal resource consumption. We have\ngathered over 1,300 test questions and iteratively adjusted the difficulty of\nMorphoBench based on the reasoning capabilities of models such as o3 and GPT-5.\nMorphoBench enhances the comprehensiveness and validity of model reasoning\nevaluation, providing reliable guidance for improving both the reasoning\nabilities and scientific robustness of large models. The code has been released\nin https://github.com/OpenDCAI/MorphoBench.",
