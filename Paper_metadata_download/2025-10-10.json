Empirical results on this\nbenchmark reveal that existing MLLMs exhibit significant performance deficits\nin long-chain reflective reasoning. To address this limitation, we generate\npost-training data and further explore learning paradigms for exploiting such\ndata. We first develop the Step-Elicited Response Generation pipeline to create\nMM-HELIX-100K, a large-scale dataset of 100k high-quality, reflective reasoning\ntraces for instruction-tuning stage. Given that standard Reinforcement Learning\nfails on complex tasks due to sparse reward signals and catastrophic forgetting\nafter Supervised Fine-Tuning, we propose Adaptive Hybrid Policy Optimization\n(AHPO), a novel training strategy that dynamically unifies offline supervision\nand online optimization into a single stage. This strategy enables the model to\nlearn from expert data when rewards are sparse and conduct independent\nexploration once proficient. When applied to the Qwen2.5-VL-7B baseline, our\nmethod achieves a +18.6\\% accuracy improvement on MM-HELIX benchmark and\ndemonstrates strong generalization with a +5.7\\% average performance gain on\ngeneral mathematic and logic tasks. Our work demonstrate that reflective\nreasoning in MLLMs can be effectively learned and generalized, paving the way\nfor developing more capable MLLMs.",

In this\nwork, we present UniVideo, a versatile framework that extends unified modeling\nto the video domain. UniVideo adopts a dual-stream design, combining a\nMultimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) for instruction understanding with a\nMultimodal DiT (MMDiT) for video generation. This design enables accurate\ninterpretation of complex multimodal instructions while preserving visual\nconsistency. Built on this architecture, UniVideo unifies diverse video\ngeneration and editing tasks under a single multimodal instruction paradigm and\nis jointly trained across them. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniVideo\nmatches or surpasses state-of-the-art task-specific baselines in\ntext/image-to-video generation, in-context video generation and in-context\nvideo editing. Notably, the unified design of UniVideo enables two forms of\ngeneralization. First, UniVideo supports task composition, such as combining\nediting with style transfer, by integrating multiple capabilities within a\nsingle instruction. Second, even without explicit training on free-form video\nediting, UniVideo transfers its editing capability from large-scale image\nediting data to this setting, handling unseen instructions such as\ngreen-screening characters or changing materials within a video. Beyond these\ncore capabilities, UniVideo also supports visual-prompt-based video generation,\nwhere the MLLM interprets visual prompts and guides the MMDiT during synthesis.\nTo foster future research, we will release our model and code.",

In this work, we investigate whether this\nphenomenon can extend beyond safety behaviors to a broader spectrum of\ndishonesty and deception under high-stakes scenarios (e.g., lying under\npressure and deceptive behavior). To explore this, we finetune open-sourced\nLLMs on misaligned completions across diverse domains. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that LLMs show broadly misaligned behavior in dishonesty.\nAdditionally, we further explore this phenomenon in a downstream combined\nfinetuning setting, and find that introducing as little as 1% of misalignment\ndata into a standard downstream task is sufficient to decrease honest behavior\nover 20%. Furthermore, we consider a more practical human-AI interaction\nenvironment where we simulate both benign and biased users to interact with the\nassistant LLM. Notably, we find that the assistant can be misaligned\nunintentionally to exacerbate its dishonesty with only 10% biased user\npopulation. In summary, we extend the study of emergent misalignment to the\ndomain of dishonesty and deception under high-stakes scenarios, and demonstrate\nthat this risk arises not only through direct finetuning, but also in\ndownstream mixture tasks and practical human-AI interactions.",

    "summary": "Previous research has shown that LLMs finetuned on malicious or incorrect\ncompletions within narrow domains (e.g., insecure code or incorrect medical\nadvice) can become broadly misaligned to exhibit harmful behaviors, which is\ncalled emergent misalignment. In this work, we investigate whether this\nphenomenon can extend beyond safety behaviors to a broader spectrum of\ndishonesty and deception under high-stakes scenarios (e.g., lying under\npressure and deceptive behavior). To explore this, we finetune open-sourced\nLLMs on misaligned completions across diverse domains. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that LLMs show broadly misaligned behavior in dishonesty.\nAdditionally, we further explore this phenomenon in a downstream combined\nfinetuning setting, and find that introducing as little as 1% of misalignment\ndata into a standard downstream task is sufficient to decrease honest behavior\nover 20%. Furthermore, we consider a more practical human-AI interaction\nenvironment where we simulate both benign and biased users to interact with the\nassistant LLM. Notably, we find that the assistant can be misaligned\nunintentionally to exacerbate its dishonesty with only 10% biased user\npopulation. In summary, we extend the study of emergent misalignment to the\ndomain of dishonesty and deception under high-stakes scenarios, and demonstrate\nthat this risk arises not only through direct finetuning, but also in\ndownstream mixture tasks and practical human-AI interactions.",

We propose DeepMiner, a novel framework that elicits such\nabilities by introducing high-difficulty training tasks and dynamic context\nwindow. DeepMiner presents a reverse construction method to generate complex\nbut verifiable question-answer pairs from authentic web sources, which ensures\nthe challenge and reliability of training data while injecting cognitive\ncapabilities into multi-turn reasoning scenarios. We further design an elegant\nyet effective dynamic context management strategy for both training and\ninference, utilizing sliding window mechanisms while eliminating the dependency\non external summarization models, thereby efficiently empowering the model to\nhandle continuously expanding long-horizon contexts. Through reinforcement\nlearning on Qwen3-32B, we develop DeepMiner-32B, which achieves substantial\nperformance improvements across multiple search agent benchmarks. DeepMiner\nattains 33.5% accuracy on BrowseComp-en, surpassing the previous best\nopen-source agent by almost 20 percentage points, and demonstrates consistent\nimprovements on BrowseComp-zh, XBench-DeepSearch, and GAIA. Notably, our\ndynamic context management enables sustained interactions of nearly 100 turns\nwithin standard 32k context length, effectively addressing the context\nlimitations that constrain existing multi-turn interaction systems.",

    "summary": "While recent advances in reasoning models have demonstrated cognitive\nbehaviors through reinforcement learning, existing approaches struggle to\ninvoke deep reasoning capabilities in multi-turn agents with long-horizon\ninteractions. We propose DeepMiner, a novel framework that elicits such\nabilities by introducing high-difficulty training tasks and dynamic context\nwindow. DeepMiner presents a reverse construction method to generate complex\nbut verifiable question-answer pairs from authentic web sources, which ensures\nthe challenge and reliability of training data while injecting cognitive\ncapabilities into multi-turn reasoning scenarios. We further design an elegant\nyet effective dynamic context management strategy for both training and\ninference, utilizing sliding window mechanisms while eliminating the dependency\non external summarization models, thereby efficiently empowering the model to\nhandle continuously expanding long-horizon contexts. Through reinforcement\nlearning on Qwen3-32B, we develop DeepMiner-32B, which achieves substantial\nperformance improvements across multiple search agent benchmarks. DeepMiner\nattains 33.5% accuracy on BrowseComp-en, surpassing the previous best\nopen-source agent by almost 20 percentage points, and demonstrates consistent\nimprovements on BrowseComp-zh, XBench-DeepSearch, and GAIA. Notably, our\ndynamic context management enables sustained interactions of nearly 100 turns\nwithin standard 32k context length, effectively addressing the context\nlimitations that constrain existing multi-turn interaction systems.",

      "summary": "Reward model (RM) plays a pivotal role in aligning large language model (LLM)\nwith human preferences. As real-world applications increasingly involve long\nhistory trajectories, e.g., LLM agent, it becomes indispensable to evaluate\nwhether a model's responses are not only high-quality but also grounded in and\nconsistent with the provided context. Yet, current RMs remain confined to\nshort-context settings and primarily focus on response-level attributes (e.g.,\nsafety or helpfulness), while largely neglecting the critical dimension of long\ncontext-response consistency. In this work, we introduce Long-RewardBench, a\nbenchmark specifically designed for long-context RM evaluation, featuring both\nPairwise Comparison and Best-of-N tasks. Our preliminary study reveals that\neven state-of-the-art generative RMs exhibit significant fragility in\nlong-context scenarios, failing to maintain context-aware preference judgments.\nMotivated by the analysis of failure patterns observed in model outputs, we\npropose a general multi-stage training strategy that effectively scales\narbitrary models into robust Long-context RMs (LongRMs). Experiments show that\nour approach not only substantially improves performance on long-context\nevaluation but also preserves strong short-context capability. Notably, our 8B\nLongRM outperforms much larger 70B-scale baselines and matches the performance\nof the proprietary Gemini 2.5 Pro model.",

    "title": "LongRM: Revealing and Unlocking the Context Boundary of Reward Modeling",
    "summary": "Reward model (RM) plays a pivotal role in aligning large language model (LLM)\nwith human preferences. As real-world applications increasingly involve long\nhistory trajectories, e.g., LLM agent, it becomes indispensable to evaluate\nwhether a model's responses are not only high-quality but also grounded in and\nconsistent with the provided context. Yet, current RMs remain confined to\nshort-context settings and primarily focus on response-level attributes (e.g.,\nsafety or helpfulness), while largely neglecting the critical dimension of long\ncontext-response consistency. In this work, we introduce Long-RewardBench, a\nbenchmark specifically designed for long-context RM evaluation, featuring both\nPairwise Comparison and Best-of-N tasks. Our preliminary study reveals that\neven state-of-the-art generative RMs exhibit significant fragility in\nlong-context scenarios, failing to maintain context-aware preference judgments.\nMotivated by the analysis of failure patterns observed in model outputs, we\npropose a general multi-stage training strategy that effectively scales\narbitrary models into robust Long-context RMs (LongRMs). Experiments show that\nour approach not only substantially improves performance on long-context\nevaluation but also preserves strong short-context capability. Notably, our 8B\nLongRM outperforms much larger 70B-scale baselines and matches the performance\nof the proprietary Gemini 2.5 Pro model.",

In this paper, we\npropose a real-to-real 3D data generation framework (R2RGen) that directly\naugments the pointcloud observation-action pairs to generate real-world data.\nR2RGen is simulator- and rendering-free, thus being efficient and\nplug-and-play. Specifically, given a single source demonstration, we introduce\nan annotation mechanism for fine-grained parsing of scene and trajectory. A\ngroup-wise augmentation strategy is proposed to handle complex multi-object\ncompositions and diverse task constraints. We further present camera-aware\nprocessing to align the distribution of generated data with real-world 3D\nsensor. Empirically, R2RGen substantially enhances data efficiency on extensive\nexperiments and demonstrates strong potential for scaling and application on\nmobile manipulation.",

Instead of compressing data into\ntokens for slow online text-to-3D optimization, we introduce a data rectifier\nparadigm that efficiently converts unconstrained inputs into clean, orthogonal\nmulti-view images in a single forward pass within seconds, simplifying the 3D\nreconstruction. Central to UP2You is a pose-correlated feature aggregation\nmodule (PCFA), that selectively fuses information from multiple reference\nimages w.r.t. target poses, enabling better identity preservation and nearly\nconstant memory footprint, with more observations. We also introduce a\nperceiver-based multi-reference shape predictor, removing the need for\npre-captured body templates. Extensive experiments on 4D-Dress, PuzzleIOI, and\nin-the-wild captures demonstrate that UP2You consistently surpasses previous\nmethods in both geometric accuracy (Chamfer-15%, P2S-18% on PuzzleIOI) and\ntexture fidelity (PSNR-21%, LPIPS-46% on 4D-Dress). UP2You is efficient (1.5\nminutes per person), and versatile (supports arbitrary pose control, and\ntraining-free multi-garment 3D virtual try-on), making it practical for\nreal-world scenarios where humans are casually captured.
