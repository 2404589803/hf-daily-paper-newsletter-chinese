While RL is essential for LLMs' reasoning\ncapabilities, it is resource-intensive, requiring substantial GPU memory and\nlong rollout durations. QeRL addresses these issues by combining NVFP4\nquantization with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), accelerating rollout phase of RL\nwhile reducing memory overhead. Beyond efficiency, our findings show that\nquantization noise increases policy entropy, enhancing exploration, and\nenabling the discovery of better strategies during RL. To further optimize\nexploration, QeRL introduces an Adaptive Quantization Noise (AQN) mechanism,\nwhich dynamically adjusts noise during training. Experiments demonstrate that\nQeRL delivers over 1.5 times speedup in the rollout phase. Moreover, this is\nthe first framework to enable RL training of a 32B LLM on a single H100 80GB\nGPU, while delivering overall speedups for RL training. It also achieves faster\nreward growth and higher final accuracy than 16-bit LoRA and QLoRA, while\nmatching the performance of full-parameter fine-tuning on mathematical\nbenchmarks such as GSM8K (90.8%) and MATH 500 (77.4%) in the 7B model.

To bridge this gap, we introduce\nOmniVideoBench, a large-scale and rigorously designed benchmark dedicated to\nassessing synergistic audio-visual understanding, with a strong emphasis on\nmodality complementarity and logical consistency. Specifically, OmniVideoBench\ncomprises 1000 high-quality question-answer(QA) pairs, each annotated with\nstep-by-step reasoning traces, derived from 628 diverse videos ranging from\nseveral seconds to 30 minutes, and manually verified to guarantee complete\ncorrectness and uniqueness. Moreover, OmniVideoBench encompasses 13 carefully\ndesigned question types, covering temporal reasoning, spatial localization,\ncounting, causal inference, summarization, and beyond, thereby capturing the\nessential challenges of video understanding. Evaluation of multiple MLLMs on\nOmniVideoBench reveals a pronounced gap between model performance and human\nreasoning, with open-source models lagging significantly behind their\nclosed-source counterparts, underscoring the inherent difficulty of genuine\naudio-visual reasoning. We will release OmniVideoBench to foster the\ndevelopment of MLLMs with stronger and more generalizable reasoning\ncapabilities.",

In this paper, we undertake a pioneering\nexploration of multimodal RLVR through the novel perspective of token\nperception, which measures the visual dependency of each generated token. With\na granular analysis of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) processes, we uncover two key\ninsights: first, token perception in a rollout trajectory is sparsely\ndistributed, where only a small fraction of tokens have high visual dependency\nfor visually-grounded reasoning; second, different trajectories exhibit\nsignificant divergence in their overall visual dependency. Based on these\nobservations, we propose Visually-Perceptive Policy Optimization (VPPO), a\nnovel policy gradient algorithm that explicitly leverages token perception to\nrefine the learning signal. Specifically, VPPO achieves this through a dual\nmechanism: it reweights a trajectory's advantage by its overall visual\ndependency, and focuses policy updates exclusively on perceptually pivotal\ntokens. On a comprehensive suite of eight perception and reasoning benchmarks,\nVPPO demonstrates substantial gains over leading open-source RL-tuned models,\nwith its effectiveness consistently validated across 7B and 32B model scales.\nOur findings not only establish a new token-level perceptual perspective for\nanalyzing multimodal RLVR but also present a novel and effective optimization\nstrategy to significantly enhance the multimodal reasoning capabilities of\nLVLMs.",

      "summary": "Mathematical reasoning is a primary indicator of large language models (LLMs)\nintelligence. However, existing LLMs exhibit failures of robustness and\ngeneralization. This paper attributes these deficiencies to spurious reasoning,\ni.e., producing answers from superficial features. To address this challenge,\nwe propose the AdaR framework to enable adaptive reasoning, wherein models rely\non problem-solving logic to produce answers.

    "summary": "Mathematical reasoning is a primary indicator of large language models (LLMs)\nintelligence. However, existing LLMs exhibit failures of robustness and\ngeneralization. This paper attributes these deficiencies to spurious reasoning,\ni.e., producing answers from superficial features. To address this challenge,\nwe propose the AdaR framework to enable adaptive reasoning, wherein models rely\non problem-solving logic to produce answers. AdaR synthesizes logically\nequivalent queries by varying variable values, and trains models with RLVR on\nthese data to penalize spurious logic while encouraging adaptive logic.

      "summary": "The complexity of the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and the\nhierarchical structure of eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) filings\nmake financial auditing increasingly difficult to automate and verify. While\nlarge language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in\nunstructured text understanding, their ability to reason over structured,\ninterdependent, and taxonomy-driven financial documents remains largely\nunexplored. To fill this gap, we introduce FinAuditing, the first\ntaxonomy-aligned, structure-aware, multi-document benchmark for evaluating LLMs\non financial auditing tasks. Built from real US-GAAP-compliant XBRL filings,\nFinAuditing defines three complementary subtasks, FinSM for semantic\nconsistency, FinRE for relational consistency, and FinMR for numerical\nconsistency, each targeting a distinct aspect of structured auditing reasoning.\nWe further propose a unified evaluation framework integrating retrieval,\nclassification, and reasoning metrics across these subtasks.

    "summary": "The complexity of the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and the\nhierarchical structure of eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) filings\nmake financial auditing increasingly difficult to automate and verify. While\nlarge language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in\nunstructured text understanding, their ability to reason over structured,\ninterdependent, and taxonomy-driven financial documents remains largely\nunexplored. To fill this gap, we introduce FinAuditing, the first\ntaxonomy-aligned, structure-aware, multi-document benchmark for evaluating LLMs\non financial auditing tasks. Built from real US-GAAP-compliant XBRL filings,\nFinAuditing defines three complementary subtasks, FinSM for semantic\nconsistency, FinRE for relational consistency, and FinMR for numerical\nconsistency, each targeting a distinct aspect of structured auditing reasoning.\nWe further propose a unified evaluation framework integrating retrieval,\nclassification, and reasoning metrics across these subtasks. Extensive\nzero-shot experiments on 13 state-of-the-art LLMs reveal that current models\nperform inconsistently across semantic, relational, and mathematical\ndimensions, with accuracy drops of up to 60-90% when reasoning over\nhierarchical multi-document structures. Our findings expose the systematic\nlimitations of modern LLMs in taxonomy-grounded financial reasoning and\nestablish FinAuditing as a foundation for developing trustworthy,\nstructure-aware, and regulation-aligned financial intelligence systems.

In this work, we take an initial step\ntoward bridging embodied reasoning with VLA policy learning by introducing\nVlaser - a Vision-Language-Action Model with synergistic embodied reasoning\ncapability, which is a foundational vision-language model designed to integrate\nhigh-level reasoning with low-level control for embodied agents.

Furthermore, we\nsystematically examine how different VLM initializations affect supervised VLA\nfine-tuning, offering novel insights into mitigating the domain shift between\ninternet-scale pre-training data and embodied-specific policy learning data.\nBased on these insights, our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on the\nWidowX benchmark and competitive performance on the Google Robot benchmark.",

This gap arises mainly from the absence of suitable\nreward models to guide agentic workflows toward producing documents with\nstronger structural and stylistic quality. To address this, we propose\nDocReward, a document reward model that evaluates documents based on their\nstructure and style. We construct a multi-domain dataset DocPair of 117K paired\ndocuments, covering 32 domains and 267 document types, each including a high-\nand low-professionalism document with identical content but different structure\nand style. This enables the model to evaluate professionalism comprehensively,\nand in a textual-quality-agnostic way. DocReward is trained using the\nBradley-Terry loss to score documents, penalizing predictions that contradict\nthe annotated ranking. To assess the performance of reward models, we create a\ntest dataset containing document bundles ranked by well-educated human\nevaluators. Notably, DocReward outperforms GPT-4o and GPT-5 in accuracy by 30.6\nand 19.4 percentage points, respectively, demonstrating its superiority over\nbaselines. In an extrinsic evaluation of document generation, DocReward\nachieves a significantly higher win rate of 60.8%, compared to GPT-5's 37.7%\nwin rate, demonstrating its utility in guiding generation agents toward\nproducing human-preferred documents.",

We construct a multi-domain dataset DocPair of 117K paired\ndocuments, covering 32 domains and 267 document types, each including a high-\nand low-professionalism document with identical content but different structure\nand style. This enables the model to evaluate professionalism comprehensively,\nand in a textual-quality-agnostic way. DocReward is trained using the\nBradley-Terry loss to score documents, penalizing predictions that contradict\nthe annotated ranking. To assess the performance of reward models, we create a\ntest dataset containing document bundles ranked by well-educated human\nevaluators. Notably, DocReward outperforms GPT-4o and GPT-5 in accuracy by 30.6\nand 19.4 percentage points, respectively, demonstrating its superiority over\nbaselines. In an extrinsic evaluation of document generation, DocReward\nachieves a significantly higher win rate of 60.8%, compared to GPT-5's 37.7%\nwin rate, demonstrating its utility in guiding generation agents toward\nproducing human-preferred documents.",

While AI-vs-human detection usually\ntreats AI as a single category we show that individual LLMs leave unique\nstylistic signatures, even among models belonging to the same family or\nparameter size. To this end, we introduce LLM-NodeJS, a dataset of 50,000\nNode.js back-end programs from 20 large language models. Each has four\ntransformed variants, yielding 250,000 unique JavaScript samples and two\nadditional representations (JSIR and AST) for diverse research applications.\nUsing this dataset, we benchmark traditional machine learning classifiers\nagainst fine-tuned Transformer encoders and introduce CodeT5-JSA, a custom\narchitecture derived from the 770M-parameter CodeT5 model with its decoder\nremoved and a modified classification head. It achieves 95.8% accuracy on\nfive-class attribution, 94.6% on ten-class, and 88.5% on twenty-class tasks,\nsurpassing other tested models such as BERT, CodeBERT, and Longformer. We\ndemonstrate that classifiers capture deeper stylistic regularities in program\ndataflow and structure, rather than relying on surface-level features.
