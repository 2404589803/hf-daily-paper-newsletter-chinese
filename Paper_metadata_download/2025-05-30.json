      "summary": "Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have\nsignificantly enhanced performance on 2D visual tasks. However, improving their\nspatial intelligence remains a challenge. Existing 3D MLLMs always rely on\nadditional 3D or 2.5D data to incorporate spatial awareness, restricting their\nutility in scenarios with only 2D inputs, such as images or videos. In this\npaper, we present Spatial-MLLM, a novel framework for visual-based spatial\nreasoning from purely 2D observations. Unlike conventional video MLLMs which\nrely on CLIP-based visual encoders optimized for semantic understanding, our\nkey insight is to unleash the strong structure prior from the feed-forward\nvisual geometry foundation model. Specifically, we propose a dual-encoder\narchitecture: a pretrained 2D visual encoder to extract semantic features, and\na spatial encoder-initialized from the backbone of the visual geometry model-to\nextract 3D structure features. A connector then integrates both features into\nunified visual tokens for enhanced spatial understanding. Furthermore, we\npropose a space-aware frame sampling strategy at inference time, which selects\nthe spatially informative frames of a video sequence, ensuring that even under\nlimited token length, the model focuses on frames critical for spatial\nreasoning. Beyond architecture improvements, we construct the Spatial-MLLM-120k\ndataset and train the model on it using supervised fine-tuning and GRPO.\nExtensive experiments on various real-world datasets demonstrate that our\nspatial-MLLM achieves state-of-the-art performance in a wide range of\nvisual-based spatial understanding and reasoning tasks.

We start by designing\nthe tokenizer that converts images into sequences of discrete tokens, where\ntokens in different positions can be decoded into different diffusion denoising\nsteps in the pixel space. Thanks to the diffusion properties, these tokens\nnaturally follow a coarse-to-fine order, which directly lends itself to\nautoregressive modeling. Therefore, we apply standard next-token prediction on\nthese tokens, without modifying any underlying designs (either causal masks or\ntraining/inference strategies), and such sequential autoregressive token\ngeneration directly mirrors the diffusion procedure in image space. That is,\nonce the autoregressive model generates an increment of tokens, we can directly\ndecode these tokens into the corresponding diffusion denoising step in the\nstreaming manner. Our pipeline naturally reveals several intriguing properties,\nfor example, it supports consistent previews when generating only a subset of\ntokens and enables zero-shot layout-controlled synthesis. On the standard\nImageNet benchmark, our method achieves 2.09 FID using a 775M Llama backbone\nwith 256 discrete tokens.

      "summary": "Recent studies have shown that long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning can\nsignificantly enhance the performance of large language models (LLMs) on\ncomplex tasks. However, this benefit is yet to be demonstrated in the domain of\nvideo understanding, since most existing benchmarks lack the reasoning depth\nrequired to demonstrate the advantages of extended CoT chains. While recent\nefforts have proposed benchmarks aimed at video reasoning, the tasks are often\nknowledge-driven and do not rely heavily on visual content. To bridge this gap,\nwe introduce VideoReasonBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate vision-centric,\ncomplex video reasoning. To ensure visual richness and high reasoning\ncomplexity, each video in VideoReasonBench depicts a sequence of fine-grained\noperations on a latent state that is only visible in part of the video. The\nquestions evaluate three escalating levels of video reasoning skills: recalling\nobserved visual information, inferring the content of latent states, and\npredicting information beyond the video. Under such task setting, models have\nto precisely recall multiple operations in the video, and perform step-by-step\nreasoning to get correct final answers for these questions. Using\nVideoReasonBench, we comprehensively evaluate 18 state-of-the-art multimodal\nLLMs (MLLMs), finding that most perform poorly on complex video reasoning,\ne.g., GPT-4o achieves only 6.9% accuracy, while the thinking-enhanced\nGemini-2.5-Pro significantly outperforms others with 56.0% accuracy. Our\ninvestigations on \"test-time scaling\" further reveal that extended thinking\nbudget, while offering none or minimal benefits on existing video benchmarks,\nis essential for improving the performance on VideoReasonBench.",

    "title": "VideoReasonBench: Can MLLMs Perform Vision-Centric Complex Video\n  Reasoning?",
    "summary": "Recent studies have shown that long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning can\nsignificantly enhance the performance of large language models (LLMs) on\ncomplex tasks. However, this benefit is yet to be demonstrated in the domain of\nvideo understanding, since most existing benchmarks lack the reasoning depth\nrequired to demonstrate the advantages of extended CoT chains. While recent\nefforts have proposed benchmarks aimed at video reasoning, the tasks are often\nknowledge-driven and do not rely heavily on visual content. To bridge this gap,\nwe introduce VideoReasonBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate vision-centric,\ncomplex video reasoning. To ensure visual richness and high reasoning\ncomplexity, each video in VideoReasonBench depicts a sequence of fine-grained\noperations on a latent state that is only visible in part of the video. The\nquestions evaluate three escalating levels of video reasoning skills: recalling\nobserved visual information, inferring the content of latent states, and\npredicting information beyond the video. Under such task setting, models have\nto precisely recall multiple operations in the video, and perform step-by-step\nreasoning to get correct final answers for these questions. Using\nVideoReasonBench, we comprehensively evaluate 18 state-of-the-art multimodal\nLLMs (MLLMs), finding that most perform poorly on complex video reasoning,\ne.g., GPT-4o achieves only 6.9% accuracy, while the thinking-enhanced\nGemini-2.5-Pro significantly outperforms others with 56.0% accuracy. Our\ninvestigations on \"test-time scaling\" further reveal that extended thinking\nbudget, while offering none or minimal benefits on existing video benchmarks,\nis essential for improving the performance on VideoReasonBench.",

In this work, we propose On-Policy RL with Optimal\nreward baseline (OPO), a novel and simplified reinforcement learning algorithm\ndesigned to address these challenges. OPO emphasizes the importance of exact\non-policy training, which empirically stabilizes the training process and\nenhances exploration. Moreover, OPO introduces the optimal reward baseline that\ntheoretically minimizes gradient variance. We evaluate OPO on mathematical\nreasoning benchmarks. The results demonstrate its superior performance and\ntraining stability without additional models or regularization terms.\nFurthermore, OPO achieves lower policy shifts and higher output entropy,\nencouraging more diverse and less repetitive responses. These results highlight\nOPO as a promising direction for stable and effective reinforcement learning in\nlarge language model alignment and reasoning tasks. The implementation is\nprovided at https://github.com/microsoft/LMOps/tree/main/opo.",

    "summary": "Reinforcement learning algorithms are fundamental to align large language\nmodels with human preferences and to enhance their reasoning capabilities.\nHowever, current reinforcement learning algorithms often suffer from training\ninstability due to loose on-policy constraints and computational inefficiency\ndue to auxiliary models. In this work, we propose On-Policy RL with Optimal\nreward baseline (OPO), a novel and simplified reinforcement learning algorithm\ndesigned to address these challenges. OPO emphasizes the importance of exact\non-policy training, which empirically stabilizes the training process and\nenhances exploration. Moreover, OPO introduces the optimal reward baseline that\ntheoretically minimizes gradient variance. We evaluate OPO on mathematical\nreasoning benchmarks. The results demonstrate its superior performance and\ntraining stability without additional models or regularization terms.\nFurthermore, OPO achieves lower policy shifts and higher output entropy,\nencouraging more diverse and less repetitive responses. These results highlight\nOPO as a promising direction for stable and effective reinforcement learning in\nlarge language model alignment and reasoning tasks. The implementation is\nprovided at https://github.com/microsoft/LMOps/tree/main/opo.",

      "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising potential in persuasion,\nbut existing works on training LLM persuaders are still preliminary. Notably,\nwhile humans are skilled in modeling their opponent's thoughts and opinions\nproactively and dynamically, current LLMs struggle with such Theory of Mind\n(ToM) reasoning, resulting in limited diversity and opponent awareness. To\naddress this limitation, we introduce Theory of Mind Augmented Persuader\n(ToMAP), a novel approach for building more flexible persuader agents by\nincorporating two theory of mind modules that enhance the persuader's awareness\nand analysis of the opponent's mental state. Specifically, we begin by\nprompting the persuader to consider possible objections to the target central\nclaim, and then use a text encoder paired with a trained MLP classifier to\npredict the opponent's current stance on these counterclaims. Our carefully\ndesigned reinforcement learning schema enables the persuader learns how to\nanalyze opponent-related information and utilize it to generate more effective\narguments. Experiments show that the ToMAP persuader, while containing only 3B\nparameters, outperforms much larger baselines, like GPT-4o, with a relative\ngain of 39.4% across multiple persuadee models and diverse corpora.

    "title": "ToMAP: Training Opponent-Aware LLM Persuaders with Theory of Mind",
    "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising potential in persuasion,\nbut existing works on training LLM persuaders are still preliminary. Notably,\nwhile humans are skilled in modeling their opponent's thoughts and opinions\nproactively and dynamically, current LLMs struggle with such Theory of Mind\n(ToM) reasoning, resulting in limited diversity and opponent awareness. To\naddress this limitation, we introduce Theory of Mind Augmented Persuader\n(ToMAP), a novel approach for building more flexible persuader agents by\nincorporating two theory of mind modules that enhance the persuader's awareness\nand analysis of the opponent's mental state. Specifically, we begin by\nprompting the persuader to consider possible objections to the target central\nclaim, and then use a text encoder paired with a trained MLP classifier to\npredict the opponent's current stance on these counterclaims. Our carefully\ndesigned reinforcement learning schema enables the persuader learns how to\nanalyze opponent-related information and utilize it to generate more effective\narguments. Experiments show that the ToMAP persuader, while containing only 3B\nparameters, outperforms much larger baselines, like GPT-4o, with a relative\ngain of 39.4% across multiple persuadee models and diverse corpora. Notably,\nToMAP exhibits complex reasoning chains and reduced repetition during training,\nwhich leads to more diverse and effective arguments. The opponent-aware feature\nof ToMAP also makes it suitable for long conversations and enables it to employ\nmore logical and opponent-aware strategies. These results underscore our\nmethod's effectiveness and highlight its potential for developing more\npersuasive language agents. Code is available at:\nhttps://github.com/ulab-uiuc/ToMAP.",

However, traditional automated\ntheorem proving (ATP) approaches rely heavily on formal proof systems that\npoorly align with LLMs' strength derived from informal, natural language\nknowledge acquired during pre-training. In this work, we propose DeepTheorem, a\ncomprehensive informal theorem-proving framework exploiting natural language to\nenhance LLM mathematical reasoning. DeepTheorem includes a large-scale\nbenchmark dataset consisting of 121K high-quality IMO-level informal theorems\nand proofs spanning diverse mathematical domains, rigorously annotated for\ncorrectness, difficulty, and topic categories, accompanied by systematically\nconstructed verifiable theorem variants. We devise a novel reinforcement\nlearning strategy (RL-Zero) explicitly tailored to informal theorem proving,\nleveraging the verified theorem variants to incentivize robust mathematical\ninference. Additionally, we propose comprehensive outcome and process\nevaluation metrics examining proof correctness and the quality of reasoning\nsteps. Extensive experimental analyses demonstrate DeepTheorem significantly\nimproves LLM theorem-proving performance compared to existing datasets and\nsupervised fine-tuning protocols, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy and\nreasoning quality. Our findings highlight DeepTheorem's potential to\nfundamentally advance automated informal theorem proving and mathematical\nexploration.",

    "title": "DeepTheorem: Advancing LLM Reasoning for Theorem Proving Through Natural\n  Language and Reinforcement Learning",
    "summary": "Theorem proving serves as a major testbed for evaluating complex reasoning\nabilities in large language models (LLMs). However, traditional automated\ntheorem proving (ATP) approaches rely heavily on formal proof systems that\npoorly align with LLMs' strength derived from informal, natural language\nknowledge acquired during pre-training. In this work, we propose DeepTheorem, a\ncomprehensive informal theorem-proving framework exploiting natural language to\nenhance LLM mathematical reasoning. DeepTheorem includes a large-scale\nbenchmark dataset consisting of 121K high-quality IMO-level informal theorems\nand proofs spanning diverse mathematical domains, rigorously annotated for\ncorrectness, difficulty, and topic categories, accompanied by systematically\nconstructed verifiable theorem variants. We devise a novel reinforcement\nlearning strategy (RL-Zero) explicitly tailored to informal theorem proving,\nleveraging the verified theorem variants to incentivize robust mathematical\ninference. Additionally, we propose comprehensive outcome and process\nevaluation metrics examining proof correctness and the quality of reasoning\nsteps. Extensive experimental analyses demonstrate DeepTheorem significantly\nimproves LLM theorem-proving performance compared to existing datasets and\nsupervised fine-tuning protocols, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy and\nreasoning quality. Our findings highlight DeepTheorem's potential to\nfundamentally advance automated informal theorem proving and mathematical\nexploration.",

Training or evaluating doctor LLMs in\nsuch settings requires realistic patient interaction systems.

To address this, we introduce PatientSim, a patient simulator that\ngenerates realistic and diverse patient personas for clinical scenarios,\ngrounded in medical expertise. PatientSim operates using: 1) clinical profiles,\nincluding symptoms and medical history, derived from real-world data in the\nMIMIC-ED and MIMIC-IV datasets, and 2) personas defined by four axes:\npersonality, language proficiency, medical history recall level, and cognitive\nconfusion level, resulting in 37 unique combinations. We evaluated eight LLMs\nfor factual accuracy and persona consistency. The top-performing open-source\nmodel, Llama 3.3, was validated by four clinicians to confirm the robustness of\nour framework. As an open-source, customizable platform, PatientSim provides a\nreproducible and scalable solution that can be customized for specific training\nneeds. Offering a privacy-compliant environment, it serves as a robust testbed\nfor evaluating medical dialogue systems across diverse patient presentations\nand shows promise as an educational tool for healthcare.",

    "summary": "Doctor-patient consultations require multi-turn, context-aware communication\ntailored to diverse patient personas. Training or evaluating doctor LLMs in\nsuch settings requires realistic patient interaction systems. However, existing\nsimulators often fail to reflect the full range of personas seen in clinical\npractice. To address this, we introduce PatientSim, a patient simulator that\ngenerates realistic and diverse patient personas for clinical scenarios,\ngrounded in medical expertise. PatientSim operates using: 1) clinical profiles,\nincluding symptoms and medical history, derived from real-world data in the\nMIMIC-ED and MIMIC-IV datasets, and 2) personas defined by four axes:\npersonality, language proficiency, medical history recall level, and cognitive\nconfusion level, resulting in 37 unique combinations. We evaluated eight LLMs\nfor factual accuracy and persona consistency. The top-performing open-source\nmodel, Llama 3.3, was validated by four clinicians to confirm the robustness of\nour framework. As an open-source, customizable platform, PatientSim provides a\nreproducible and scalable solution that can be customized for specific training\nneeds. Offering a privacy-compliant environment, it serves as a robust testbed\nfor evaluating medical dialogue systems across diverse patient presentations\nand shows promise as an educational tool for healthcare.",

Despite\nits empirical success, the theoretical justification behind its log-ratio\nreward parameterization remains incomplete. In this work, we address this gap\nby utilizing the Differential Information Distribution (DID): a distribution\nover token sequences that captures the information gained during policy\nupdates. First, we show that when preference labels encode the differential\ninformation required to transform a reference policy into a target policy, the\nlog-ratio reward in DPO emerges as the uniquely optimal form for learning the\ntarget policy via preference optimization. This result naturally yields a\nclosed-form expression for the optimal sampling distribution over rejected\nresponses. Second, we find that the condition for preferences to encode\ndifferential information is fundamentally linked to an implicit assumption\nregarding log-margin ordered policies-an inductive bias widely used in\npreference optimization yet previously unrecognized. Finally, by analyzing the\nentropy of the DID, we characterize how learning low-entropy differential\ninformation reinforces the policy distribution, while high-entropy differential\ninformation induces a smoothing effect, which explains the log-likelihood\ndisplacement phenomenon. We validate our theoretical findings in synthetic\nexperiments and extend them to real-world instruction-following datasets. Our\nresults suggest that learning high-entropy differential information is crucial\nfor general instruction-following, while learning low-entropy differential\ninformation benefits knowledge-intensive question answering.

Existing approaches\npredominantly rely on UV-based inpainting to refine textures after reprojecting\nthe generated multi-view images onto the 3D shapes, which introduces challenges\nrelated to topological ambiguity. To address this, we propose to bypass the\nlimitations of UV mapping by operating directly in a unified 3D functional\nspace. Specifically, we first propose that lifts texture generation into 3D\nspace via Texture Functions (TFs)--a continuous, volumetric representation that\nmaps any 3D point to a texture value based solely on surface proximity,\nindependent of mesh topology. Then, we propose to predict these TFs directly\nfrom images and geometry inputs using a transformer-based Large Texturing Model\n(LTM). To further enhance texture quality and leverage powerful 2D priors, we\ndevelop an advanced LoRA-based strategy for efficiently adapting large-scale\nDiffusion Transformers (DiTs) for high-quality multi-view texture synthesis as\nour first stage.

We quantify the knowledge of LLMs at both the triplet and entity\nlevels, and analyze how it relates to graph structural properties such as node\ndegree. Furthermore, we uncover the knowledge homophily, where topologically\nclose entities exhibit similar levels of knowledgeability, which further\nmotivates us to develop graph machine learning models to estimate entity\nknowledge based on its local neighbors. This model further enables valuable\nknowledge checking by selecting triplets less known to LLMs. Empirical results\nshow that using selected triplets for fine-tuning leads to superior\nperformance.",

    "summary": "Large language models have been extensively studied as neural knowledge bases\nfor their knowledge access, editability, reasoning, and explainability.\nHowever, few works focus on the structural patterns of their knowledge.\nMotivated by this gap, we investigate these structural patterns from a graph\nperspective. We quantify the knowledge of LLMs at both the triplet and entity\nlevels, and analyze how it relates to graph structural properties such as node\ndegree. Furthermore, we uncover the knowledge homophily, where topologically\nclose entities exhibit similar levels of knowledgeability, which further\nmotivates us to develop graph machine learning models to estimate entity\nknowledge based on its local neighbors. This model further enables valuable\nknowledge checking by selecting triplets less known to LLMs. Empirical results\nshow that using selected triplets for fine-tuning leads to superior\nperformance.",

VidText offers the following key features: 1) It covers a wide\nrange of real-world scenarios and supports multilingual content, encompassing\ndiverse settings where video text naturally appears. 2) It introduces a\nhierarchical evaluation framework with video-level, clip-level, and\ninstance-level tasks, enabling assessment of both global summarization and\nlocal retrieval capabilities. 3) The benchmark also introduces a set of paired\nperception reasoning tasks, ranging from visual text perception to cross-modal\nreasoning between textual and visual information. Extensive experiments on 18\nstate-of-the-art Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) reveal that current models\nstruggle across most tasks, with significant room for improvement.

We introduce Adaptive Classifier-Free Guidance (A-CFG), a novel\nmethod that tailors the unconditional input by leveraging the model's\ninstantaneous predictive confidence. At each step of an iterative (masked)\ndiffusion language model, A-CFG identifies tokens in the currently generated\nsequence for which the model exhibits low confidence. These tokens are\ntemporarily re-masked to create a dynamic, localized unconditional input. This\nfocuses CFG's corrective influence precisely on areas of ambiguity, leading to\nmore effective guidance. We integrate A-CFG into a state-of-the-art masked\ndiffusion language model and demonstrate its efficacy. Experiments on diverse\nlanguage generation benchmarks show that A-CFG yields substantial improvements\nover standard CFG, achieving, for instance, a 3.9 point gain on GPQA. Our work\nhighlights the benefit of dynamically adapting guidance mechanisms to model\nuncertainty in iterative generation.",

    "summary": "Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) significantly enhances controllability in\ngenerative models by interpolating conditional and unconditional predictions.\nHowever, standard CFG often employs a static unconditional input, which can be\nsuboptimal for iterative generation processes where model uncertainty varies\ndynamically. We introduce Adaptive Classifier-Free Guidance (A-CFG), a novel\nmethod that tailors the unconditional input by leveraging the model's\ninstantaneous predictive confidence. At each step of an iterative (masked)\ndiffusion language model, A-CFG identifies tokens in the currently generated\nsequence for which the model exhibits low confidence. These tokens are\ntemporarily re-masked to create a dynamic, localized unconditional input. This\nfocuses CFG's corrective influence precisely on areas of ambiguity, leading to\nmore effective guidance. We integrate A-CFG into a state-of-the-art masked\ndiffusion language model and demonstrate its efficacy. Experiments on diverse\nlanguage generation benchmarks show that A-CFG yields substantial improvements\nover standard CFG, achieving, for instance, a 3.9 point gain on GPQA. Our work\nhighlights the benefit of dynamically adapting guidance mechanisms to model\nuncertainty in iterative generation.",
