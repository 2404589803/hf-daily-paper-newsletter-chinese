In this work, we\nintroduce DeepEyesV2 and explore how to build an agentic multimodal model from\nthe perspectives of data construction, training methods, and model evaluation.\nWe observe that direct reinforcement learning alone fails to induce robust\ntool-use behavior. This phenomenon motivates a two-stage training pipeline: a\ncold-start stage to establish tool-use patterns, and reinforcement learning\nstage to further refine tool invocation. We curate a diverse, moderately\nchallenging training dataset, specifically including examples where tool use is\nbeneficial. We further introduce RealX-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark\ndesigned to evaluate real-world multimodal reasoning, which inherently requires\nthe integration of multiple capabilities, including perception, search, and\nreasoning. We evaluate DeepEyesV2 on RealX-Bench and other representative\nbenchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness across real-world understanding,\nmathematical reasoning, and search-intensive tasks. Moreover, DeepEyesV2\nexhibits task-adaptive tool invocation, tending to use image operations for\nperception tasks and numerical computations for reasoning tasks. Reinforcement\nlearning further enables complex tool combinations and allows model to\nselectively invoke tools based on context.

Furthermore, we demonstrate that general chatbot proficiency is a\npoor predictor of villain role-playing ability, with highly safety-aligned\nmodels performing particularly poorly. Our work provides the first systematic\nevidence of this critical limitation, highlighting a key tension between model\nsafety and creative fidelity. Our benchmark and findings pave the way for\ndeveloping more nuanced, context-aware alignment methods.",
