However, these paradigms have inherent limitations. (1)\nImages capture only single moments and fail to represent dynamic processes or\ncontinuous changes, and (2) The separation of text and vision as distinct\nmodalities, hindering unified multimodal understanding and generation. To\novercome these limitations, we introduce \"Thinking with Video\", a new paradigm\nthat leverages video generation models, such as Sora-2, to bridge visual and\ntextual reasoning in a unified temporal framework. To support this exploration,\nwe developed the Video Thinking Benchmark (VideoThinkBench). VideoThinkBench\nencompasses two task categories: (1) vision-centric tasks (e.g., Eyeballing\nPuzzles), and (2) text-centric tasks (e.g., subsets of GSM8K, MMMU). Our\nevaluation establishes Sora-2 as a capable reasoner. On vision-centric tasks,\nSora-2 is generally comparable to state-of-the-art (SOTA) VLMs, and even\nsurpasses VLMs on several tasks, such as Eyeballing Games. On text-centric\ntasks, Sora-2 achieves 92% accuracy on MATH, and 75.53% accuracy on MMMU.\nFurthermore, we systematically analyse the source of these abilities. We also\nfind that self-consistency and in-context learning can improve Sora-2's\nperformance. In summary, our findings demonstrate that the video generation\nmodel is the potential unified multimodal understanding and generation model,\npositions \"thinking with video\" as a unified multimodal reasoning paradigm.",

The\nreleased corpus contains over 1.2M executed action steps across thousands of\ntrajectories in popular Windows office applications, and includes\nfull-resolution screenshots, accessibility metadata when available,\ninstantiated goals, intermediate reasoning traces, and both successful and\nfailed action trajectories. The dataset supports three canonical tasks, GUI\ngrounding, screen parsing, and action prediction, and a hybrid GUI+API action\nspace that reflects modern agent designs. Benchmarking state-of-the-art\nvision--language models on GUI-360^circ reveals substantial out-of-the-box\nshortcomings in grounding and action prediction; supervised fine-tuning and\nreinforcement learning yield significant gains but do not close the gap to\nhuman-level reliability. We release GUI-360^circ and accompanying code to\nfacilitate reproducible research and accelerate progress on robust desktop\nCUAs.\n  The full dataset has been made public on\nhttps://huggingface.co/datasets/vyokky/GUI-360.",

Yet we find that models can ace many multimodal benchmarks without\nstrong visual understanding, instead exploiting biases, linguistic priors, and\nsuperficial patterns. This is especially problematic for vision-centric\nbenchmarks that are meant to require visual inputs. We adopt a diagnostic\nprinciple for benchmark design: if a benchmark can be gamed, it will be.\nDesigners should therefore try to ``game'' their own benchmarks first, using\ndiagnostic and debiasing procedures to systematically identify and mitigate\nnon-visual biases. Effective diagnosis requires directly ``training on the test\nset'' -- probing the released test set for its intrinsic, exploitable patterns.\n  We operationalize this standard with two components. First, we diagnose\nbenchmark susceptibility using a ``Test-set Stress-Test'' (TsT) methodology.\nOur primary diagnostic tool involves fine-tuning a powerful Large Language\nModel via k-fold cross-validation on exclusively the non-visual, textual\ninputs of the test set to reveal shortcut performance and assign each sample a\nbias score s(x). We complement this with a lightweight Random Forest-based\ndiagnostic operating on hand-crafted features for fast, interpretable auditing.\nSecond, we debias benchmarks by filtering high-bias samples using an\n``Iterative Bias Pruning'' (IBP) procedure. Applying this framework to four\nbenchmarks -- VSI-Bench, CV-Bench, MMMU, and VideoMME -- we uncover pervasive\nnon-visual biases. As a case study, we apply our full framework to create\nVSI-Bench-Debiased, demonstrating reduced non-visual solvability and a wider\nvision-blind performance gap than the original.",
