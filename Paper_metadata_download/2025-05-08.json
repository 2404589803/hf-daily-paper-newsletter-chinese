In this paper,\nwe propose HunyuanCustom, a multi-modal customized video generation framework\nthat emphasizes subject consistency while supporting image, audio, video, and\ntext conditions. Built upon HunyuanVideo, our model first addresses the\nimage-text conditioned generation task by introducing a text-image fusion\nmodule based on LLaVA for enhanced multi-modal understanding, along with an\nimage ID enhancement module that leverages temporal concatenation to reinforce\nidentity features across frames. To enable audio- and video-conditioned\ngeneration, we further propose modality-specific condition injection\nmechanisms: an AudioNet module that achieves hierarchical alignment via spatial\ncross-attention, and a video-driven injection module that integrates\nlatent-compressed conditional video through a patchify-based feature-alignment\nnetwork. Extensive experiments on single- and multi-subject scenarios\ndemonstrate that HunyuanCustom significantly outperforms state-of-the-art open-\nand closed-source methods in terms of ID consistency, realism, and text-video\nalignment. Moreover, we validate its robustness across downstream tasks,\nincluding audio and video-driven customized video generation.

To address this limitation, we propose\nImage-Event Fusion for Video Anomaly Detection (IEF-VAD), a framework that\nsynthesizes event representations directly from RGB videos and fuses them with\nimage features through a principled, uncertainty-aware process. The system (i)\nmodels heavy-tailed sensor noise with a Student`s-t likelihood, deriving\nvalue-level inverse-variance weights via a Laplace approximation; (ii) applies\nKalman-style frame-wise updates to balance modalities over time; and (iii)\niteratively refines the fused latent state to erase residual cross-modal noise.\nWithout any dedicated event sensor or frame-level labels, IEF-VAD sets a new\nstate of the art across multiple real-world anomaly detection benchmarks. These\nfindings highlight the utility of synthetic event representations in\nemphasizing motion cues that are often underrepresented in RGB frames, enabling\naccurate and robust video understanding across diverse applications without\nrequiring dedicated event sensors.

While promising, such methods suffer from two flaws.\nFirst, they rely on predetermined data domains (e.g., data sources, task\ntypes), which may fail to capture critical semantic nuances, leaving\nperformance on the table. Second, these methods scale with the number of\ndomains in a computationally prohibitive way. We address these challenges via\nR&B, a framework that re-partitions training data based on semantic similarity\n(Regroup) to create finer-grained domains, and efficiently optimizes the data\ncomposition (Balance) by leveraging a Gram matrix induced by domain gradients\nobtained throughout training. Unlike prior works, it removes the need for\nadditional compute to obtain evaluation information such as losses or\ngradients. We analyze this technique under standard regularity conditions and\nprovide theoretical insights that justify R&B's effectiveness compared to\nnon-adaptive mixing approaches. Empirically, we demonstrate the effectiveness\nof R&B on five diverse datasets ranging from natural language to reasoning and\nmultimodal tasks.
