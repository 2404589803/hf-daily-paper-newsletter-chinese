      "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) can self-improve through reinforcement learning,\nwhere they generate trajectories to explore and discover better solutions.\nHowever, this exploration process is computationally expensive, often forcing\ncurrent methods to assign limited exploration budgets to each task. This\nuniform allocation creates problematic edge cases: easy tasks consistently\nsucceed while difficult tasks consistently fail, both producing zero gradients\nduring training updates for the widely used Group Relative Policy Optimization\n(GRPO). We address this problem from the lens of exploration budget allocation.\nViewing each task's exploration as an \"item\" with a distinct \"value\" and\n\"cost\", we establish a connection to the classical knapsack problem. This\nformulation allows us to derive an optimal assignment rule that adaptively\ndistributes resources based on the model's current learning status. When\napplied to GRPO, our method increases the effective ratio of non-zero policy\ngradients by 20-40% during training. Acting as a computational \"free lunch\",\nour approach could reallocate exploration budgets from tasks where learning is\nsaturated to those where it is most impactful. This enables significantly\nlarger budgets (e.g., 93 rollouts) for especially challenging problems, which\nwould be computationally prohibitive under a uniform allocation. These\nimprovements translate to meaningful gains on mathematical reasoning\nbenchmarks, with average improvements of 2-4 points and peak gains of 9 points\non specific tasks. Notably, achieving comparable performance with traditional\nhomogeneous allocation would require about 2x the computational resources.",

    "title": "Knapsack RL: Unlocking Exploration of LLMs via Optimizing Budget\n  Allocation",
    "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) can self-improve through reinforcement learning,\nwhere they generate trajectories to explore and discover better solutions.\nHowever, this exploration process is computationally expensive, often forcing\ncurrent methods to assign limited exploration budgets to each task. This\nuniform allocation creates problematic edge cases: easy tasks consistently\nsucceed while difficult tasks consistently fail, both producing zero gradients\nduring training updates for the widely used Group Relative Policy Optimization\n(GRPO). We address this problem from the lens of exploration budget allocation.\nViewing each task's exploration as an \"item\" with a distinct \"value\" and\n\"cost\", we establish a connection to the classical knapsack problem. This\nformulation allows us to derive an optimal assignment rule that adaptively\ndistributes resources based on the model's current learning status. When\napplied to GRPO, our method increases the effective ratio of non-zero policy\ngradients by 20-40% during training. Acting as a computational \"free lunch\",\nour approach could reallocate exploration budgets from tasks where learning is\nsaturated to those where it is most impactful. This enables significantly\nlarger budgets (e.g., 93 rollouts) for especially challenging problems, which\nwould be computationally prohibitive under a uniform allocation. These\nimprovements translate to meaningful gains on mathematical reasoning\nbenchmarks, with average improvements of 2-4 points and peak gains of 9 points\non specific tasks. Notably, achieving comparable performance with traditional\nhomogeneous allocation would require about 2x the computational resources.",

In this work, we study why, by\nreverse-engineering a model that successfully learns multiplication via\nimplicit chain-of-thought, and report three findings: (1) Evidence of\nlong-range structure: Logit attributions and linear probes indicate that the\nmodel encodes the necessary long-range dependencies for multi-digit\nmultiplication. (2) Mechanism: the model encodes long-range dependencies using\nattention to construct a directed acyclic graph to ``cache'' and ``retrieve''\npairwise partial products. (3) Geometry: the model implements partial products\nin attention heads by forming Minkowski sums between pairs of digits, and\ndigits are represented using a Fourier basis, both of which are intuitive and\nefficient representations that the standard fine-tuning model lacks. With these\ninsights, we revisit the learning dynamics of standard fine-tuning and find\nthat the model converges to a local optimum that lacks the required long-range\ndependencies. We further validate this understanding by introducing an\nauxiliary loss that predicts the ``running sum'' via a linear regression probe,\nwhich provides an inductive bias that enables the model to successfully learn\nmulti-digit multiplication. In summary, by reverse-engineering the mechanisms\nof an implicit chain-of-thought model we uncover a pitfall for learning\nlong-range dependencies in Transformers and provide an example of how the\ncorrect inductive bias can address this issue.",

    "title": "Why Can't Transformers Learn Multiplication? Reverse-Engineering Reveals\n  Long-Range Dependency Pitfalls",
    "summary": "Language models are increasingly capable, yet still fail at a seemingly\nsimple task of multi-digit multiplication. In this work, we study why, by\nreverse-engineering a model that successfully learns multiplication via\nimplicit chain-of-thought, and report three findings: (1) Evidence of\nlong-range structure: Logit attributions and linear probes indicate that the\nmodel encodes the necessary long-range dependencies for multi-digit\nmultiplication. (2) Mechanism: the model encodes long-range dependencies using\nattention to construct a directed acyclic graph to ``cache'' and ``retrieve''\npairwise partial products. (3) Geometry: the model implements partial products\nin attention heads by forming Minkowski sums between pairs of digits, and\ndigits are represented using a Fourier basis, both of which are intuitive and\nefficient representations that the standard fine-tuning model lacks. With these\ninsights, we revisit the learning dynamics of standard fine-tuning and find\nthat the model converges to a local optimum that lacks the required long-range\ndependencies. We further validate this understanding by introducing an\nauxiliary loss that predicts the ``running sum'' via a linear regression probe,\nwhich provides an inductive bias that enables the model to successfully learn\nmulti-digit multiplication. In summary, by reverse-engineering the mechanisms\nof an implicit chain-of-thought model we uncover a pitfall for learning\nlong-range dependencies in Transformers and provide an example of how the\ncorrect inductive bias can address this issue.",

Debiasing performances are systematically compared and\nanalyzed across key dimensions: the prompting vs. training paradigm, model\nsize, and generalization of different training strategies to unseen bias types.\nWe will publicly release our benchmark, aiming to establish a unified testbed\nfor bias mitigation research.",

While PRMs have been\nextensively studied in text-based domains, their extension to Vision Language\nModels (VLMs) remains limited. Existing Vision-Language PRMs (VL-PRMs) rely on\nMonte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for data construction, which can often produce\nnoisy supervision signals and limit generalization across tasks. In this work,\nwe aim to elucidate the design space of VL-PRMs by exploring diverse strategies\nfor dataset construction, training, and test-time scaling. First, we introduce\na hybrid data synthesis framework that combines MCTS with judgments from a\nstrong VLM, producing more accurate step-level labels. Second, we propose\nperception-focused supervision, enabling our PRM to explicitly detect errors at\nthe visual grounding stage of reasoning. Third, we systematically evaluate\nmultiple test-time scaling strategies, showing that our PRMs can reliably guide\nVLMs toward more accurate solutions. Our experiments covering five diverse\nmultimodal benchmarks (MMMU, PuzzleVQA, AlgoPuzzleVQA, MathVista, and\nMathVision) reveal several key insights: (i) VL-PRMs when used as Outcome\nReward Models (ORMs) during test-time scaling (TTS) can outperform VL-PRM\nguided process step selection, (ii) smaller VL-PRMs can match or even surpass\nlarger ones in detecting process errors, (iii) VL-PRMs uncover latent reasoning\nabilities in stronger VLM backbones, (iv) perception-level supervision leads to\nsignificant gains in test-time scaling, and (v) TTS performance of different\npolicies improve on advanced math reasoning datasets despite not training\nVL-PRMs on such datasets. We hope our work will motivate further research and\nsupport the advancement of VLMs.",

Second, we propose\nperception-focused supervision, enabling our PRM to explicitly detect errors at\nthe visual grounding stage of reasoning. Third, we systematically evaluate\nmultiple test-time scaling strategies, showing that our PRMs can reliably guide\nVLMs toward more accurate solutions. Our experiments covering five diverse\nmultimodal benchmarks (MMMU, PuzzleVQA, AlgoPuzzleVQA, MathVista, and\nMathVision) reveal several key insights: (i) VL-PRMs when used as Outcome\nReward Models (ORMs) during test-time scaling (TTS) can outperform VL-PRM\nguided process step selection, (ii) smaller VL-PRMs can match or even surpass\nlarger ones in detecting process errors, (iii) VL-PRMs uncover latent reasoning\nabilities in stronger VLM backbones, (iv) perception-level supervision leads to\nsignificant gains in test-time scaling, and (v) TTS performance of different\npolicies improve on advanced math reasoning datasets despite not training\nVL-PRMs on such datasets. We hope our work will motivate further research and\nsupport the advancement of VLMs.",

This\nfailure stems from a fundamental mismatch, as generating exact numerical\ncoordinates is a challenging task for language-centric architectures. In this\npaper, we introduce VLM-FO1, a novel framework that overcomes this limitation\nby reframing object-centric perception from a brittle coordinate generation\nproblem into a robust feature retrieval task. Our method operates as a\nplug-and-play module that integrates with any pre-trained VLM. It leverages a\nHybrid Fine-grained Region Encoder (HFRE), featuring a dual vision encoder, to\ngenerate powerful region tokens rich in both semantic and spatial detail. A\ntoken-based referencing system then enables the LLM to seamlessly reason about\nand ground language in these specific visual regions. Experiments show that\nVLM-FO1 achieves state-of-the-art performance across a diverse suite of\nbenchmarks, demonstrating exceptional capabilities in object grounding, region\ngenerational understanding, and visual region reasoning. Crucially, our\ntwo-stage training strategy ensures that these perception gains are achieved\nwithout compromising the base model's general visual understanding\ncapabilities. VLM-FO1 establishes an effective and flexible paradigm for\nbuilding perception-aware VLMs, bridging the gap between high-level reasoning\nand fine-grained visual grounding.",

    "title": "VLM-FO1: Bridging the Gap Between High-Level Reasoning and Fine-Grained\n  Perception in VLMs",
    "summary": "Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at high-level scene understanding but\nfalter on fine-grained perception tasks requiring precise localization. This\nfailure stems from a fundamental mismatch, as generating exact numerical\ncoordinates is a challenging task for language-centric architectures. In this\npaper, we introduce VLM-FO1, a novel framework that overcomes this limitation\nby reframing object-centric perception from a brittle coordinate generation\nproblem into a robust feature retrieval task. Our method operates as a\nplug-and-play module that integrates with any pre-trained VLM. It leverages a\nHybrid Fine-grained Region Encoder (HFRE), featuring a dual vision encoder, to\ngenerate powerful region tokens rich in both semantic and spatial detail. A\ntoken-based referencing system then enables the LLM to seamlessly reason about\nand ground language in these specific visual regions. Experiments show that\nVLM-FO1 achieves state-of-the-art performance across a diverse suite of\nbenchmarks, demonstrating exceptional capabilities in object grounding, region\ngenerational understanding, and visual region reasoning. Crucially, our\ntwo-stage training strategy ensures that these perception gains are achieved\nwithout compromising the base model's general visual understanding\ncapabilities. VLM-FO1 establishes an effective and flexible paradigm for\nbuilding perception-aware VLMs, bridging the gap between high-level reasoning\nand fine-grained visual grounding.",
