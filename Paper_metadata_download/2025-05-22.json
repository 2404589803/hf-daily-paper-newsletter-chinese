Despite the importance of speed and\ncost-effectiveness, prior works have utilized MLLMs as reward models, which\nposes significant constraints for real-world deployment. To address this, in\nthis work, we propose the first process reward model (PRM) called Web-Shepherd\nwhich could assess web navigation trajectories in a step-level.

Next, we also introduce the WebRewardBench, the first\nmeta-evaluation benchmark for evaluating PRMs. In our experiments, we observe\nthat our Web-Shepherd achieves about 30 points better accuracy compared to\nusing GPT-4o on WebRewardBench. Furthermore, when testing on WebArena-lite by\nusing GPT-4o-mini as the policy and Web-Shepherd as the verifier, we achieve\n10.9 points better performance, in 10 less cost compared to using GPT-4o-mini\nas the verifier.

Further analysis shows\nthat the activation quantization error in the FC2 layer, caused by outliers, is\nthe primary bottleneck of W4A4 QAT quantization error. By applying\nmixed-precision quantization to address this bottleneck, we demonstrate that\nweight and activation quantization errors can converge to similar levels.\nAdditionally, with more training data, weight quantization error eventually\nexceeds activation quantization error, suggesting that reducing weight\nquantization error is also important in such scenarios.

      "summary": "We introduce MMaDA, a novel class of multimodal diffusion foundation models\ndesigned to achieve superior performance across diverse domains such as textual\nreasoning, multimodal understanding, and text-to-image generation. The approach\nis distinguished by three key innovations: (i) MMaDA adopts a unified diffusion\narchitecture with a shared probabilistic formulation and a modality-agnostic\ndesign, eliminating the need for modality-specific components. This\narchitecture ensures seamless integration and processing across different data\ntypes. (ii) We implement a mixed long chain-of-thought (CoT) fine-tuning\nstrategy that curates a unified CoT format across modalities. By aligning\nreasoning processes between textual and visual domains, this strategy\nfacilitates cold-start training for the final reinforcement learning (RL)\nstage, thereby enhancing the model's ability to handle complex tasks from the\noutset. (iii) We propose UniGRPO, a unified policy-gradient-based RL algorithm\nspecifically tailored for diffusion foundation models. Utilizing diversified\nreward modeling, UniGRPO unifies post-training across both reasoning and\ngeneration tasks, ensuring consistent performance improvements. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that MMaDA-8B exhibits strong generalization capabilities\nas a unified multimodal foundation model. It surpasses powerful models like\nLLaMA-3-7B and Qwen2-7B in textual reasoning, outperforms Show-o and SEED-X in\nmultimodal understanding, and excels over SDXL and Janus in text-to-image\ngeneration. These achievements highlight MMaDA's effectiveness in bridging the\ngap between pretraining and post-training within unified diffusion\narchitectures, providing a comprehensive framework for future research and\ndevelopment.

Specifically,\nwe first present a unified framework that formulates various efficient\nreasoning methods through the lens of length-based reward shaping. Building on\nthis perspective, we propose a novel Length-bAsed StEp Reward shaping method\n(LASER), which employs a step function as the reward, controlled by a target\nlength. LASER surpasses previous methods, achieving a superior Pareto-optimal\nbalance between performance and efficiency. Next, we further extend LASER based\non two key intuitions: (1) The reasoning behavior of the model evolves during\ntraining, necessitating reward specifications that are also adaptive and\ndynamic; (2) Rather than uniformly encouraging shorter or longer chains of\nthought (CoT), we posit that length-based reward shaping should be\ndifficulty-aware i.e., it should penalize lengthy CoTs more for easy queries.\nThis approach is expected to facilitate a combination of fast and slow\nthinking, leading to a better overall tradeoff.

Therefore, a lightweight alternative,\ngenerating complex 3D scenes from a single top-down image, plays an essential\nrole in real-world applications. While recent 3D generative models have\nachieved remarkable results at the object level, their extension to full-scene\ngeneration often leads to inconsistent geometry, layout hallucinations, and\nlow-quality meshes. In this work, we introduce 3DTown, a training-free\nframework designed to synthesize realistic and coherent 3D scenes from a single\ntop-down view. Our method is grounded in two principles: region-based\ngeneration to improve image-to-3D alignment and resolution, and spatial-aware\n3D inpainting to ensure global scene coherence and high-quality geometry\ngeneration. Specifically, we decompose the input image into overlapping regions\nand generate each using a pretrained 3D object generator, followed by a masked\nrectified flow inpainting process that fills in missing geometry while\nmaintaining structural continuity. This modular design allows us to overcome\nresolution bottlenecks and preserve spatial structure without requiring 3D\nsupervision or fine-tuning. Extensive experiments across diverse scenes show\nthat 3DTown outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, including Trellis,\nHunyuan3D-2, and TripoSG, in terms of geometry quality, spatial coherence, and\ntexture fidelity.

However, their\nenhanced reasoning capabilities do not necessarily translate to improved safety\nperformance-and in some cases, may even degrade it. This raises an important\nresearch question: how can we enhance the safety of LRMs? In this paper, we\npresent a comprehensive empirical study on how to enhance the safety of LRMs\nthrough Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Our investigation begins with an\nunexpected observation: directly distilling safe responses from DeepSeek-R1\nfails to significantly enhance safety. We analyze this phenomenon and identify\nthree key failure patterns that contribute to it. We then demonstrate that\nexplicitly addressing these issues during the data distillation process can\nlead to substantial safety improvements. Next, we explore whether a long and\ncomplex reasoning process is necessary for achieving safety. Interestingly, we\nfind that simply using short or template-based reasoning process can attain\ncomparable safety performance-and are significantly easier for models to learn\nthan more intricate reasoning chains. These findings prompt a deeper reflection\non the role of reasoning in ensuring safety. Finally, we find that mixing math\nreasoning data during safety fine-tuning is helpful to balance safety and\nover-refusal.

      "summary": "Human cognition typically involves thinking through abstract, fluid concepts\nrather than strictly using discrete linguistic tokens. Current reasoning\nmodels, however, are constrained to reasoning within the boundaries of human\nlanguage, processing discrete token embeddings that represent fixed points in\nthe semantic space. This discrete constraint restricts the expressive power and\nupper potential of such reasoning models, often causing incomplete exploration\nof reasoning paths, as standard Chain-of-Thought (CoT) methods rely on sampling\none token per step. In this work, we introduce Soft Thinking, a training-free\nmethod that emulates human-like \"soft\" reasoning by generating soft, abstract\nconcept tokens in a continuous concept space. These concept tokens are created\nby the probability-weighted mixture of token embeddings, which form the\ncontinuous concept space, enabling smooth transitions and richer\nrepresentations that transcend traditional discrete boundaries. In essence,\neach generated concept token encapsulates multiple meanings from related\ndiscrete tokens, implicitly exploring various reasoning paths to converge\neffectively toward the correct answer. Empirical evaluations on diverse\nmathematical and coding benchmarks consistently demonstrate the effectiveness\nand efficiency of Soft Thinking, improving pass@1 accuracy by up to 2.48 points\nwhile simultaneously reducing token usage by up to 22.4% compared to standard\nCoT. Qualitative analysis further reveals that Soft Thinking outputs remain\nhighly interpretable and readable, highlighting the potential of Soft Thinking\nto break the inherent bottleneck of discrete language-based reasoning.

    "title": "Soft Thinking: Unlocking the Reasoning Potential of LLMs in Continuous\n  Concept Space",
    "summary": "Human cognition typically involves thinking through abstract, fluid concepts\nrather than strictly using discrete linguistic tokens. Current reasoning\nmodels, however, are constrained to reasoning within the boundaries of human\nlanguage, processing discrete token embeddings that represent fixed points in\nthe semantic space. This discrete constraint restricts the expressive power and\nupper potential of such reasoning models, often causing incomplete exploration\nof reasoning paths, as standard Chain-of-Thought (CoT) methods rely on sampling\none token per step. In this work, we introduce Soft Thinking, a training-free\nmethod that emulates human-like \"soft\" reasoning by generating soft, abstract\nconcept tokens in a continuous concept space. These concept tokens are created\nby the probability-weighted mixture of token embeddings, which form the\ncontinuous concept space, enabling smooth transitions and richer\nrepresentations that transcend traditional discrete boundaries. In essence,\neach generated concept token encapsulates multiple meanings from related\ndiscrete tokens, implicitly exploring various reasoning paths to converge\neffectively toward the correct answer. Empirical evaluations on diverse\nmathematical and coding benchmarks consistently demonstrate the effectiveness\nand efficiency of Soft Thinking, improving pass@1 accuracy by up to 2.48 points\nwhile simultaneously reducing token usage by up to 22.4% compared to standard\nCoT. Qualitative analysis further reveals that Soft Thinking outputs remain\nhighly interpretable and readable, highlighting the potential of Soft Thinking\nto break the inherent bottleneck of discrete language-based reasoning.

While reinforcement learning (RL) offers a\npromising solution,current methods struggle to simultaneously achieve stable,\nefficient fine-tuning and support non-differentiable rewards.

To\naddress these limitations, dense and differentiable signals are required\nthroughout the diffusion process.

Our method maintains proximity to the\npretrained model while enabling effective and stable training via\nbackpropagation.
