However, activating such capabilities through training\nremains challenging, as existing methods predominantly rely on supervised\nfine-tuning (SFT) over synthetic data, which encourages teacher-forced\nimitation rather than exploration and generalization. Different from them, we\npropose Parallel-R1, the first reinforcement learning (RL) framework\nthat enables parallel thinking behaviors for complex real-world reasoning\ntasks. Our framework employs a progressive curriculum that explicitly addresses\nthe cold-start problem in training parallel thinking with RL. We first use SFT\non prompt-generated trajectories from easier tasks to instill the parallel\nthinking ability, then transition to RL to explore and generalize this skill on\nharder problems. Experiments on various math benchmarks, including MATH, AMC23,\nand AIME, show that Parallel-R1 successfully instills parallel thinking,\nleading to 8.4% accuracy improvements over the sequential thinking model\ntrained directly on challenging tasks with RL. Further analysis reveals a clear\nshift in the model's thinking behavior: at an early stage, it uses parallel\nthinking as an exploration strategy, while in a later stage, it uses the same\ncapability for multi-perspective verification. Most significantly, we validate\nparallel thinking as a mid-training exploration scaffold, where this\ntemporary exploratory phase unlocks a higher performance ceiling after RL,\nyielding a 42.9% improvement over the baseline on AIME25.

However, conventional training relies on\nimage-text pairs (or sequences) whose captions are typically sparse and miss\nfine-grained visual details--even when they use hundreds of words to describe a\nsimple image. We introduce Reconstruction Alignment (RecA), a\nresource-efficient post-training method that leverages visual understanding\nencoder embeddings as dense \"text prompts,\" providing rich supervision without\ncaptions. Concretely, RecA conditions a UMM on its own visual understanding\nembeddings and optimizes it to reconstruct the input image with a\nself-supervised reconstruction loss, thereby realigning understanding and\ngeneration. Despite its simplicity, RecA is broadly applicable: across\nautoregressive, masked-autoregressive, and diffusion-based UMMs, it\nconsistently improves generation and editing fidelity. With only 27 GPU-hours,\npost-training with RecA substantially improves image generation performance on\nGenEval (0.73rightarrow0.90) and DPGBench (80.93rightarrow88.15), while\nalso boosting editing benchmarks (ImgEdit 3.38rightarrow3.75, GEdit\n6.94rightarrow7.25).

However, existing RLVR methods often suffer from exploration\ninefficiency due to mismatches between the training data's difficulty and the\nmodel's capability.

In this work, we formalize the impact of problem difficulty by\nquantifying the relationship between loss descent speed and rollout accuracy.\nBuilding on this analysis, we propose SEELE, a novel supervision-aided RLVR\nframework that dynamically adjusts problem difficulty to stay within the\nhigh-efficiency region. SEELE augments each training sample by appending a hint\n(part of a full solution) after the original problem. Unlike previous\nhint-based approaches, SEELE deliberately and adaptively adjusts the hint\nlength for each problem to achieve an optimal difficulty. To determine the\noptimal hint length, SEELE employs a multi-round rollout sampling strategy. In\neach round, it fits an item response theory model to the accuracy-hint pairs\ncollected in preceding rounds to predict the required hint length for the next\nround. This instance-level, real-time difficulty adjustment aligns problem\ndifficulty with the evolving model capability, thereby improving exploration\nefficiency. Experimental results show that SEELE outperforms Group Relative\nPolicy Optimization (GRPO) and Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) by +11.8 and +10.5\npoints, respectively, and surpasses the best previous supervision-aided\napproach by +3.6 points on average across six math reasoning benchmarks.",

      "summary": "Text-to-image diffusion models are computationally intensive, often requiring\ndozens of forward passes through large transformer backbones. For instance,\nStable Diffusion XL generates high-quality images with 50 evaluations of a\n2.6B-parameter model, an expensive process even for a single batch. Few-step\ndiffusion models reduce this cost to 2-8 denoising steps but still depend on\nlarge, uncompressed U-Net or diffusion transformer backbones, which are often\ntoo costly for full-precision inference without datacenter GPUs. These\nrequirements also limit existing post-training quantization methods that rely\non full-precision calibration. We introduce Q-Sched, a new paradigm for\npost-training quantization that modifies the diffusion model scheduler rather\nthan model weights. By adjusting the few-step sampling trajectory, Q-Sched\nachieves full-precision accuracy with a 4x reduction in model size. To learn\nquantization-aware pre-conditioning coefficients, we propose the JAQ loss,\nwhich combines text-image compatibility with an image quality metric for\nfine-grained optimization. JAQ is reference-free and requires only a handful of\ncalibration prompts, avoiding full-precision inference during calibration.\nQ-Sched delivers substantial gains: a 15.5% FID improvement over the FP16\n4-step Latent Consistency Model and a 16.6% improvement over the FP16 8-step\nPhased Consistency Model, showing that quantization and few-step distillation\nare complementary for high-fidelity generation. A large-scale user study with\nmore than 80,000 annotations further confirms Q-Sched's effectiveness on both\nFLUX.1[schnell] and SDXL-Turbo.",
