We find that attention weights can be separated into two\nparts: a small fraction of large weights with high rank and the remaining\nweights with very low rank. This naturally suggests applying sparse\nacceleration to the first part and low-rank acceleration to the second. Based\non this finding, we propose SLA (Sparse-Linear Attention), a trainable\nattention method that fuses sparse and linear attention to accelerate diffusion\nmodels. SLA classifies attention weights into critical, marginal, and\nnegligible categories, applying O(N^2) attention to critical weights, O(N)\nattention to marginal weights, and skipping negligible ones. SLA combines these\ncomputations into a single GPU kernel and supports both forward and backward\npasses. With only a few fine-tuning steps using SLA, DiT models achieve a 20x\nreduction in attention computation, resulting in significant acceleration\nwithout loss of generation quality. Experiments show that SLA reduces attention\ncomputation by 95% without degrading end-to-end generation quality,\noutperforming baseline methods. In addition, we implement an efficient GPU\nkernel for SLA, which yields a 13.7x speedup in attention computation and a\n2.2x end-to-end speedup in video generation on Wan2.1-1.3B.",

While existing datasets have covered basic tasks like style\ntransfer and simple object manipulation, they often lack the systematic\nstructure and challenging scenarios required for real-world applications. To\naddress this bottleneck, we introduce OpenGPT-4o-Image, a large-scale dataset\nconstructed using a novel methodology that combines hierarchical task taxonomy\nwith automated data generation. Our taxonomy not only includes fundamental\ncapabilities such as text rendering and style control but also introduces\nhighly practical yet challenging categories like scientific imagery for\nchemistry illustrations and complex instruction editing requiring simultaneous\nexecution of multiple operations. Through an automated pipeline leveraging\nstructured resource pools and GPT-4o, we generate 80k high-quality\ninstruction-image pairs with controlled diversity, covering 11 major domains\nand 51 subtasks. Extensive experiments show that fine-tuning leading models on\nour dataset achieves significant performance gains across multiple benchmarks,\nwith improvements of up to 18\\% on editing tasks (UniWorld-V1 on ImgEdit-Bench)\nand 13% on generation tasks (Harmon on GenEval). Our work demonstrates that\nsystematic data construction is key to advancing multimodal AI capabilities.",

    "summary": "The performance of unified multimodal models for image generation and editing\nis fundamentally constrained by the quality and comprehensiveness of their\ntraining data. While existing datasets have covered basic tasks like style\ntransfer and simple object manipulation, they often lack the systematic\nstructure and challenging scenarios required for real-world applications. To\naddress this bottleneck, we introduce OpenGPT-4o-Image, a large-scale dataset\nconstructed using a novel methodology that combines hierarchical task taxonomy\nwith automated data generation. Our taxonomy not only includes fundamental\ncapabilities such as text rendering and style control but also introduces\nhighly practical yet challenging categories like scientific imagery for\nchemistry illustrations and complex instruction editing requiring simultaneous\nexecution of multiple operations. Through an automated pipeline leveraging\nstructured resource pools and GPT-4o, we generate 80k high-quality\ninstruction-image pairs with controlled diversity, covering 11 major domains\nand 51 subtasks. Extensive experiments show that fine-tuning leading models on\nour dataset achieves significant performance gains across multiple benchmarks,\nwith improvements of up to 18\\% on editing tasks (UniWorld-V1 on ImgEdit-Bench)\nand 13% on generation tasks (Harmon on GenEval). Our work demonstrates that\nsystematic data construction is key to advancing multimodal AI capabilities.",

Two core designs ensure our efficient, effective and long video\ngeneration: (1) Linear DiT: We leverage linear attention as the core operation,\nwhich is more efficient than vanilla attention given the large number of tokens\nprocessed in video generation. (2) Constant-Memory KV cache for Block Linear\nAttention: we design block-wise autoregressive approach for long video\ngeneration by employing a constant-memory state, derived from the cumulative\nproperties of linear attention. This KV cache provides the Linear DiT with\nglobal context at a fixed memory cost, eliminating the need for a traditional\nKV cache and enabling efficient, minute-long video generation. In addition, we\nexplore effective data filters and model training strategies, narrowing the\ntraining cost to 12 days on 64 H100 GPUs, which is only 1% of the cost of\nMovieGen. Given its low cost, SANA-Video achieves competitive performance\ncompared to modern state-of-the-art small diffusion models (e.g., Wan 2.1-1.3B\nand SkyReel-V2-1.3B) while being 16x faster in measured latency. Moreover,\nSANA-Video can be deployed on RTX 5090 GPUs with NVFP4 precision, accelerating\nthe inference speed of generating a 5-second 720p video from 71s to 29s (2.4x\nspeedup).

      "summary": "Instruction-guided image editing has achieved remarkable progress, yet\ncurrent models still face challenges with complex instructions and often\nrequire multiple samples to produce a desired result. Reinforcement Learning\n(RL) offers a promising solution, but its adoption in image editing has been\nseverely hindered by the lack of a high-fidelity, efficient reward signal.

Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nVideoScore2 achieves superior performance with 44.35 (+5.94) accuracy on our\nin-domain benchmark VideoScore-Bench-v2 and 50.37 (+4.32) average performance\nacross four out-of-domain benchmarks (VideoGenReward-Bench, VideoPhy2, etc),\nwhile providing interpretable assessments that bridge the gap between\nevaluation and controllable generation through effective reward modeling for\nBest-of-N sampling.

      "summary": "We introduce SIRI, Scaling Iterative Reinforcement Learning with Interleaved\nCompression, a simple yet effective RL approach for Large Reasoning Models\n(LRMs) that enables more efficient and accurate reasoning. Existing studies\nhave observed repetitive thinking patterns in LRMs, and attempts to reduce them\noften come at the cost of performance. In this paper, we show that this\ntrade-off can be overcome through a training regime that iteratively alternates\nbetween compressing and expanding the reasoning budget, by dynamically\nadjusting the maximum rollout length during training. The compression phase\ncuts the rollout length, forcing the model to make precise and valuable\ndecisions within a limited context, which effectively reduces redundant tokens\nand increases reasoning density. The expansion phase then relaxes the length\nlimit, providing space for the model to explore and plan in long-horizon\nsettings. Remarkably, we find that after each compression-expansion cycle, the\nmodel's performance improves even as its output length decreases, steadily\npushing it closer to the Pareto frontier in the performance-efficiency\ntrade-off. Training on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, SIRI-low improves\nperformance on AIME24 by 43.2% while reducing token usage by 46.9% after three\niterations, and SIRI-high achieves the highest accuracy compared to all other\nmethods (Figure 1). Our findings shed light on the potential of periodically\noscillating the LRM's output truncation length during training to dynamically\nbalance exploration and efficiency in reasoning, converging towards an optimal\n\"sweet spot\" between the two. Our models are publicly available.",

    "title": "SIRI: Scaling Iterative Reinforcement Learning with Interleaved\n  Compression",
    "summary": "We introduce SIRI, Scaling Iterative Reinforcement Learning with Interleaved\nCompression, a simple yet effective RL approach for Large Reasoning Models\n(LRMs) that enables more efficient and accurate reasoning. Existing studies\nhave observed repetitive thinking patterns in LRMs, and attempts to reduce them\noften come at the cost of performance. In this paper, we show that this\ntrade-off can be overcome through a training regime that iteratively alternates\nbetween compressing and expanding the reasoning budget, by dynamically\nadjusting the maximum rollout length during training. The compression phase\ncuts the rollout length, forcing the model to make precise and valuable\ndecisions within a limited context, which effectively reduces redundant tokens\nand increases reasoning density. The expansion phase then relaxes the length\nlimit, providing space for the model to explore and plan in long-horizon\nsettings. Remarkably, we find that after each compression-expansion cycle, the\nmodel's performance improves even as its output length decreases, steadily\npushing it closer to the Pareto frontier in the performance-efficiency\ntrade-off. Training on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, SIRI-low improves\nperformance on AIME24 by 43.2% while reducing token usage by 46.9% after three\niterations, and SIRI-high achieves the highest accuracy compared to all other\nmethods (Figure 1). Our findings shed light on the potential of periodically\noscillating the LRM's output truncation length during training to dynamically\nbalance exploration and efficiency in reasoning, converging towards an optimal\n\"sweet spot\" between the two. Our models are publicly available.",

To address these\nchallenges, we propose DART, a Decoupled Agentic RL Training framework for GUI\nagents, which coordinates heterogeneous modules in a highly decoupled manner.\nDART separates the training system into four asynchronous modules: environment\ncluster, rollout service, data manager, and trainer.

To facilitate effective learning from\nabundant samples, we introduce an adaptive data curation scheme: (1)\npre-collecting successful trajectories for challenging tasks to supplement\nsparse success in online sampling; (2) dynamically adjusting rollout numbers\nand trajectory lengths based on task difficulty; (3) training selectively on\nhigh-entropy steps to prioritize critical decisions; (4) stabilizing learning\nvia truncated importance sampling for policy mismatch between policy rollout\nand updating.

Extensive experiments demonstrate that MGM-Omni outperforms existing\nopen source models in preserving timbre identity across extended sequences,\nproducing natural and context-aware speech, and achieving superior long-form\naudio and omnimodal understanding.

      "summary": "The rapid progress of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) and cloud-based AI\nagents is transforming human-AI collaboration into bidirectional, multimodal\ninteraction. However, existing codecs remain optimized for unimodal, one-way\ncommunication, resulting in repeated degradation under conventional\ncompress-transmit-reconstruct pipelines. To address this limitation, we propose\nUniMIC, a Unified token-based Multimodal Interactive Coding framework that\nbridges edge devices and cloud AI agents. Instead of transmitting raw pixels or\nplain text, UniMIC employs compact tokenized representations as the\ncommunication medium, enabling efficient low-bitrate transmission while\nmaintaining compatibility with LMMs. To further enhance compression,\nlightweight Transformer-based entropy models with scenario-specific\ndesigns-generic, masked, and text-conditioned-effectively minimize inter-token\nredundancy. Extensive experiments on text-to-image generation, text-guided\ninpainting, outpainting, and visual question answering show that UniMIC\nachieves substantial bitrate savings and remains robust even at ultra-low\nbitrates (<0.05bpp), without compromising downstream task performance. These\nresults establish UniMIC as a practical and forward-looking paradigm for\nnext-generation multimodal interactive communication.",

Improving pretraining efficiency is therefore\nessential to enable the next generation of even more capable LLMs. While 8-bit\nfloating point (FP8) training is now widely adopted, transitioning to even\nnarrower precision, such as 4-bit floating point (FP4), could unlock additional\nimprovements in computational speed and resource utilization.

To address the above challenges, we present SID, a\ngoal-oriented language-guided navigation learning approach with Self-Improving\nDemonstrations. Specifically, SID learns an initial agent on the shortest-path\ndata sampled from environments and then leverages this agent to generate novel\nexploration trajectories. The novel rollouts provide demonstrations with\nstronger exploration strategies to train a better agent, which in turn produces\nhigher-quality agent demonstrations for the next round of training. We show\nthat this iterative self-improving pipeline readily scales to new environments,\nand the resulting demonstrations can be transferred across a variety of\nlanguage-guided navigation tasks, elevating the performance ceiling in diverse\ngoal-oriented navigation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SID\nsignificantly boosts the exploration capabilities and generalization of\nnavigation agents. The resulting agent achieves new state-of-the-art\nperformance on goal-oriented language-guided navigation tasks, including\nREVERIE, SOON, notably achieving a 50.9% success rate on the unseen validation\nsplits of SOON, surpassing the prior leading approaches by a margin of 13.9%.",

Specifically, SID learns an initial agent on the shortest-path\ndata sampled from environments and then leverages this agent to generate novel\nexploration trajectories. The novel rollouts provide demonstrations with\nstronger exploration strategies to train a better agent, which in turn produces\nhigher-quality agent demonstrations for the next round of training. We show\nthat this iterative self-improving pipeline readily scales to new environments,\nand the resulting demonstrations can be transferred across a variety of\nlanguage-guided navigation tasks, elevating the performance ceiling in diverse\ngoal-oriented navigation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SID\nsignificantly boosts the exploration capabilities and generalization of\nnavigation agents. The resulting agent achieves new state-of-the-art\nperformance on goal-oriented language-guided navigation tasks, including\nREVERIE, SOON, notably achieving a 50.9% success rate on the unseen validation\nsplits of SOON, surpassing the prior leading approaches by a margin of 13.9%.",

To\nprovide a measurable geometric analysis perspective, we define the concept of\nthe Reasoning Manifold, a latent low-dimensional geometric structure formed by\nthe internal representations corresponding to all correctly reasoned\ngenerations. This structure can be conceptualized as the embodiment of the\neffective thinking paths that the model has learned to successfully solve a\ngiven task. Based on this concept, we build REMA, a framework that explains the\norigins of failures by quantitatively comparing the spatial relationships of\ninternal model representations corresponding to both erroneous and correct\nreasoning samples. Specifically, REMA first quantifies the geometric deviation\nof each erroneous representation by calculating its k-nearest neighbors\ndistance to the approximated manifold formed by correct representations,\nthereby providing a unified failure signal. It then localizes the divergence\npoints where these deviations first become significant by tracking this\ndeviation metric across the model's layers and comparing it against a baseline\nof internal fluctuations from correct representations, thus identifying where\nthe reasoning chain begins to go off-track. Our extensive experiments on\ndiverse language and multimodal models and tasks demonstrate the\nlow-dimensional nature of the reasoning manifold and the high separability\nbetween erroneous and correct reasoning representations.

      "summary": "The webpage-to-code task requires models to understand visual representations\nof webpages and generate corresponding code. However, existing benchmarks\nprimarily focus on static screenshot-to-code tasks, thereby overlooking the\ndynamic interactions fundamental to real-world web applications. To address\nthis limitation, this paper introduces IWR-Bench, a novel benchmark for\nevaluating the capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) in\ninteractive webpage reconstruction from video. IWR-Bench comprises 113\nmeticulously curated tasks from 100 real-world websites, with 1,001 actions and\nfeaturing diverse interaction complexities (e.g., web games), visual styles,\nand domains. Aligning with standard web development practices, each task\nincludes not only user interaction videos but also all crawled static assets\n(e.g., images, videos). This benchmark evaluates models on two fundamental\nchallenges: comprehensive multi-modal reasoning to infer interaction logic from\nvideo and assets, and advanced code generation to translate this logic into\nfunctional code. An agent-as-a-judge framework with a comprehensive metric\nsystem automatically assesses the functional correctness and visual fidelity of\ngenerated webpages. Extensive experiments on 28 LVLMs reveal a significant\nchallenge: the best model achieves an overall score of only 36.35%, as\nfunctional correctness (24.39% IFS) lags significantly behind visual fidelity\n(64.25% VFS). These results highlight critical limitations in current models'\nability to reason about temporal dynamics and synthesize event-driven logic,\nestablishing IWR-Bench as a challenging frontier for vision-language research.\nThe benchmark and evaluation code will be made publicly available. Code is\navailable at https://github.com/L-O-I/IWR-Bench.",

However, existing benchmarks\nprimarily focus on static screenshot-to-code tasks, thereby overlooking the\ndynamic interactions fundamental to real-world web applications. To address\nthis limitation, this paper introduces IWR-Bench, a novel benchmark for\nevaluating the capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) in\ninteractive webpage reconstruction from video. IWR-Bench comprises 113\nmeticulously curated tasks from 100 real-world websites, with 1,001 actions and\nfeaturing diverse interaction complexities (e.g., web games), visual styles,\nand domains. Aligning with standard web development practices, each task\nincludes not only user interaction videos but also all crawled static assets\n(e.g., images, videos). This benchmark evaluates models on two fundamental\nchallenges: comprehensive multi-modal reasoning to infer interaction logic from\nvideo and assets, and advanced code generation to translate this logic into\nfunctional code. An agent-as-a-judge framework with a comprehensive metric\nsystem automatically assesses the functional correctness and visual fidelity of\ngenerated webpages. Extensive experiments on 28 LVLMs reveal a significant\nchallenge: the best model achieves an overall score of only 36.35%, as\nfunctional correctness (24.39% IFS) lags significantly behind visual fidelity\n(64.25% VFS). These results highlight critical limitations in current models'\nability to reason about temporal dynamics and synthesize event-driven logic,\nestablishing IWR-Bench as a challenging frontier for vision-language research.\nThe benchmark and evaluation code will be made publicly available. Code is\navailable at https://github.com/L-O-I/IWR-Bench.",
