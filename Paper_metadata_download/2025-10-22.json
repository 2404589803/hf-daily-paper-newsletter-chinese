      "summary": "Recent progress in text-to-image (T2I) generation underscores the importance\nof reliable benchmarks in evaluating how accurately generated images reflect\nthe semantics of their textual prompt. However, (1) existing benchmarks lack\nthe diversity of prompt scenarios and multilingual support, both essential for\nreal-world applicability; (2) they offer only coarse evaluations across primary\ndimensions, covering a narrow range of sub-dimensions, and fall short in\nfine-grained sub-dimension assessment. To address these limitations, we\nintroduce UniGenBench++, a unified semantic assessment benchmark for T2I\ngeneration. Specifically, it comprises 600 prompts organized hierarchically to\nensure both coverage and efficiency: (1) spans across diverse real-world\nscenarios, i.e., 5 main prompt themes and 20 subthemes; (2) comprehensively\nprobes T2I models' semantic consistency over 10 primary and 27 sub evaluation\ncriteria, with each prompt assessing multiple testpoints. To rigorously assess\nmodel robustness to variations in language and prompt length, we provide both\nEnglish and Chinese versions of each prompt in short and long forms. Leveraging\nthe general world knowledge and fine-grained image understanding capabilities\nof a closed-source Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM), i.e.,\nGemini-2.5-Pro, an effective pipeline is developed for reliable benchmark\nconstruction and streamlined model assessment. Moreover, to further facilitate\ncommunity use, we train a robust evaluation model that enables offline\nassessment of T2I model outputs.

    "title": "UniGenBench++: A Unified Semantic Evaluation Benchmark for Text-to-Image\n  Generation",
    "summary": "Recent progress in text-to-image (T2I) generation underscores the importance\nof reliable benchmarks in evaluating how accurately generated images reflect\nthe semantics of their textual prompt. However, (1) existing benchmarks lack\nthe diversity of prompt scenarios and multilingual support, both essential for\nreal-world applicability; (2) they offer only coarse evaluations across primary\ndimensions, covering a narrow range of sub-dimensions, and fall short in\nfine-grained sub-dimension assessment. To address these limitations, we\nintroduce UniGenBench++, a unified semantic assessment benchmark for T2I\ngeneration. Specifically, it comprises 600 prompts organized hierarchically to\nensure both coverage and efficiency: (1) spans across diverse real-world\nscenarios, i.e., 5 main prompt themes and 20 subthemes; (2) comprehensively\nprobes T2I models' semantic consistency over 10 primary and 27 sub evaluation\ncriteria, with each prompt assessing multiple testpoints. To rigorously assess\nmodel robustness to variations in language and prompt length, we provide both\nEnglish and Chinese versions of each prompt in short and long forms. Leveraging\nthe general world knowledge and fine-grained image understanding capabilities\nof a closed-source Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM), i.e.,\nGemini-2.5-Pro, an effective pipeline is developed for reliable benchmark\nconstruction and streamlined model assessment. Moreover, to further facilitate\ncommunity use, we train a robust evaluation model that enables offline\nassessment of T2I model outputs. Through comprehensive benchmarking of both\nopen- and closed-sourced T2I models, we systematically reveal their strengths\nand weaknesses across various aspects.",

      "summary": "Data quality plays a critical role in enhancing supervised fine-tuning (SFT)\nfor large language models (LLMs), and token-level data selection has emerged as\na promising direction for its fine-grained nature. Despite their strong\nempirical performance, existing token-level selection methods share two key\nlimitations: (1) requiring training or accessing an additional reference model,\nand (2) relying solely on loss information for token selection, which cannot\nwell preserve semantically important tokens that are not favored by loss-based\nmetrics. To address these challenges, we propose ssToken, a Self-modulated and\nSemantic-aware Token Selection approach. ssToken leverages readily accessible\nhistory models to compute the per-token loss difference with the current model,\nwhich serves as a self-modulated signal that enables the model to adaptively\nselect tokens along its optimization trajectory, rather than relying on excess\nloss from an offline-trained reference model as in prior works. We further\nintroduce a semantic-aware, attention-based token importance estimation metric,\northogonal to loss-based selection and providing complementary semantic\ninformation for more effective filtering. Extensive experiments across\ndifferent model families and scales demonstrate that both self-modulated\nselection and semantic-aware selection alone outperform full-data fine-tuning,\nwhile their integration--ssToken--achieves synergistic gains and further\nsurpasses prior token-level selection methods, delivering performance\nimprovements while maintaining training efficiency.",

    "summary": "Data quality plays a critical role in enhancing supervised fine-tuning (SFT)\nfor large language models (LLMs), and token-level data selection has emerged as\na promising direction for its fine-grained nature. Despite their strong\nempirical performance, existing token-level selection methods share two key\nlimitations: (1) requiring training or accessing an additional reference model,\nand (2) relying solely on loss information for token selection, which cannot\nwell preserve semantically important tokens that are not favored by loss-based\nmetrics. To address these challenges, we propose ssToken, a Self-modulated and\nSemantic-aware Token Selection approach. ssToken leverages readily accessible\nhistory models to compute the per-token loss difference with the current model,\nwhich serves as a self-modulated signal that enables the model to adaptively\nselect tokens along its optimization trajectory, rather than relying on excess\nloss from an offline-trained reference model as in prior works. We further\nintroduce a semantic-aware, attention-based token importance estimation metric,\northogonal to loss-based selection and providing complementary semantic\ninformation for more effective filtering. Extensive experiments across\ndifferent model families and scales demonstrate that both self-modulated\nselection and semantic-aware selection alone outperform full-data fine-tuning,\nwhile their integration--ssToken--achieves synergistic gains and further\nsurpasses prior token-level selection methods, delivering performance\nimprovements while maintaining training efficiency.",

Spatially and temporally\nsymmetric designs reduce biases and enable systematic evaluation of models'\nreasoning about self-motion and object motion. Our evaluation of 14 VLMs and\nexpert models reveals key limitations: models often conflate observer and\nobject motion, exhibit semantic biases, and fail to accurately infer relative\nrelationships in dynamic scenarios.

    "title": "DSI-Bench: A Benchmark for Dynamic Spatial Intelligence",
    "summary": "Reasoning about dynamic spatial relationships is essential, as both observers\nand objects often move simultaneously. Although vision-language models (VLMs)\nand visual expertise models excel in 2D tasks and static scenarios, their\nability to fully understand dynamic 3D scenarios remains limited. We introduce\nDynamic Spatial Intelligence and propose DSI-Bench, a benchmark with nearly\n1,000 dynamic videos and over 1,700 manually annotated questions covering nine\ndecoupled motion patterns of observers and objects. Spatially and temporally\nsymmetric designs reduce biases and enable systematic evaluation of models'\nreasoning about self-motion and object motion. Our evaluation of 14 VLMs and\nexpert models reveals key limitations: models often conflate observer and\nobject motion, exhibit semantic biases, and fail to accurately infer relative\nrelationships in dynamic scenarios. Our DSI-Bench provides valuable findings\nand insights about the future development of general and expertise models with\ndynamic spatial intelligence.",

Finally, our work\nopens up an interesting discussion on the downstream effects of distillation\npractices: since models seem to be regurgitating aspects of their training set,\ndistillation can therefore be thought of as indirectly training on the model's\noriginal dataset.",

      "summary": "Reliable verifiable data has become a key driver of capability gains in\nmodern language models, enabling stable reinforcement learning with verifiable\nrewards and effective distillation that transfers competence across math,\ncoding, and agentic tasks. Yet constructing generalizable synthetic verifiable\ndata remains difficult due to hallucination-prone generation, and weak or\ntrivial verification artifacts that fail to separate strong from weak\nsolutions. Existing approaches often rely on task-specific heuristics or\npost-hoc filters that do not transfer across domains and lack a principled,\nuniversal evaluator of verifiability. In this work, we introduce an\nevolutionary, task-agnostic, strategy-guided, executably-checkable data\nsynthesis framework that, from minimal seed supervision, jointly synthesizes\nproblems, diverse candidate solutions, and verification artifacts, and\niteratively discovers strategies via a consistency-based evaluator that\nenforces agreement between human-annotated and strategy-induced checks. This\npipeline upgrades filtering into principled synthesis: it reliably assembles\ncoherent, verifiable training instances and generalizes without domain-specific\nrules. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach\nunder both RLVR and model distillation training paradigms. The results show\nthat training with our synthesized data yields significant improvements on both\nthe LiveCodeBench and AgentBench-OS tasks, highlighting the robust\ngeneralization of our framework.",
