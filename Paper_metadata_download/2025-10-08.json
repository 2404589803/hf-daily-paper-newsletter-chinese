However, their\npotential for supervising LRMs on tabular reasoning domains remains\nunderexplored. Through detailed empirical analyses, we identify that existing\nPRMs, though widely adopted for supervising text-only reasoning steps, struggle\nwith table-specific operations such as sub-table retrieval and schema\ninteraction, leading to critical performance bottlenecks. To address this\nlimitation, we propose TaTToo, a novel table-grounded PRM framework that (i)\nreasons explicitly over tabular reasoning steps and (ii) integrates tool-based\nverification to provide precise reward supervision. Concretely, we first design\na scalable data curation pipeline that constructs over 60k high-quality\nstep-level annotations by integrating table verification rationales with\ntool-based executions. Building on the collected data, we train TaTToo with a\ndual-stage paradigm: cold-start supervised fine-tuning to capture tool-use\nreasoning patterns, followed by reinforcement learning with tool-grounded\nreward shaping to align our model with table-based verification. We provide a\ncomprehensive evaluation of the policy improvement induced by our newly\ndesigned PRM.

Our approach introduces a novel training recipe that\ncombines a block diffusion mechanism with a complementary attention mask,\nenabling blockwise bidirectional context modeling without sacrificing AR\ntraining objectives. To further accelerate decoding, we design a hierarchical\ncaching mechanism: a block-level cache that stores historical context\nrepresentations across blocks, and a sub-block cache that enables efficient\nparallel generation within partially decoded blocks. Coupled with our parallel\ndecoding pipeline, Fast-dLLM v2 achieves up to 2.5x speedup over standard AR\ndecoding without compromising generation quality.

      "summary": "RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems and web agents are increasingly\nevaluated on multi-hop deep search tasks, yet current practice suffers from two\nmajor limitations. First, most benchmarks leak the reasoning path in the\nquestion text, allowing models to follow surface cues rather than discover\nreasoning chains autonomously. Second, evaluation is typically reduced to a\nsingle pass rate, which collapses diverse behaviours into one score and\nobscures whether failures stem from inadequate search, poor knowledge use, or\ninappropriate refusal. To address these issues, we present WebDetective, a\nbenchmark of hint-free multi-hop questions paired with a controlled Wikipedia\nsandbox that ensures full traceability of model actions, and a holistic\nevaluation framework that separates search sufficiency, knowledge utilisation,\nand refusal behaviour. Our evaluation of 25 state-of-the-art models reveals\nsystematic weaknesses across all architectures: models struggle with knowledge\nutilisation despite having sufficient evidence and demonstrate near-absent\nappropriate refusal when evidence is lacking. These patterns expose a\nfundamental gap: today's systems excel at executing given reasoning paths but\nfail when required to discover them. We develop an agentic workflow,\nEvidenceLoop, that explicitly targets the challenges our benchmark identifies,\nincorporating verification loops and systematic evidence tracking that improve\nboth search and synthesis capabilities. This baseline demonstrates that\nWebDetective's diagnostic framework can guide concrete architectural\nimprovements, establishing our benchmark as a critical tool for developing\ngenuinely autonomous reasoning systems rather than pattern-following agents.",

    "summary": "RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems and web agents are increasingly\nevaluated on multi-hop deep search tasks, yet current practice suffers from two\nmajor limitations. First, most benchmarks leak the reasoning path in the\nquestion text, allowing models to follow surface cues rather than discover\nreasoning chains autonomously. Second, evaluation is typically reduced to a\nsingle pass rate, which collapses diverse behaviours into one score and\nobscures whether failures stem from inadequate search, poor knowledge use, or\ninappropriate refusal. To address these issues, we present WebDetective, a\nbenchmark of hint-free multi-hop questions paired with a controlled Wikipedia\nsandbox that ensures full traceability of model actions, and a holistic\nevaluation framework that separates search sufficiency, knowledge utilisation,\nand refusal behaviour. Our evaluation of 25 state-of-the-art models reveals\nsystematic weaknesses across all architectures: models struggle with knowledge\nutilisation despite having sufficient evidence and demonstrate near-absent\nappropriate refusal when evidence is lacking. These patterns expose a\nfundamental gap: today's systems excel at executing given reasoning paths but\nfail when required to discover them. We develop an agentic workflow,\nEvidenceLoop, that explicitly targets the challenges our benchmark identifies,\nincorporating verification loops and systematic evidence tracking that improve\nboth search and synthesis capabilities. This baseline demonstrates that\nWebDetective's diagnostic framework can guide concrete architectural\nimprovements, establishing our benchmark as a critical tool for developing\ngenuinely autonomous reasoning systems rather than pattern-following agents.",

      "summary": "Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as a simple and effective\nmethod for aligning large language models. However, its reliance on a fixed\ntemperature parameter leads to suboptimal training on diverse preference data,\ncausing overfitting on easy examples and under-learning from informative ones.\nRecent methods have emerged to counter this. While IPO addresses general\noverfitting, its uniform regularization can be overly conservative. The more\ntargeted approach of beta-DPO suffers from its own limitations: its\nbatch-level adaptation applies a single, compromised temperature to\nmixed-margin pairs, its linear update rule can produce unstable negative\nbeta values, and its filtering mechanism discards potentially useful\ntraining signals. In this work, we introduce Margin-Adaptive Direct Preference\nOptimization (MADPO), a method that provides a stable, data-preserving, and\ninstance-level solution. MADPO employs a practical two-step approach: it first\ntrains a reward model to estimate preference margins and then uses these\nmargins to apply a continuous, adaptive weight to the DPO loss for each\nindividual training sample. This re-weighting scheme creates an effective\ntarget margin that is amplified for hard pairs and dampened for easy pairs,\nallowing for granular control over the learning signal. We provide a\ncomprehensive theoretical analysis, proving that MADPO has a well-behaved\noptimization landscape and is robust to reward model estimation errors. We\nvalidate our theory with experiments on a sentiment generation task, where\nMADPO consistently and significantly outperforms strong baselines across\ndatasets of varying quality. It achieves performance gains of up to +33.3\\% on\nHigh Quality data and +10.5\\% on Low Quality data over the next-best method.\nOur results establish MADPO as a more robust and principled approach to\npreference alignment.",

      "summary": "Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) requires segmenting specific\nobjects in a video guided by a natural language description. The core challenge\nof RVOS is to anchor abstract linguistic concepts onto a specific set of pixels\nand continuously segment them through the complex dynamics of a video. Faced\nwith this difficulty, prior work has often decomposed the task into a pragmatic\n`locate-then-segment' pipeline. However, this cascaded design creates an\ninformation bottleneck by simplifying semantics into coarse geometric prompts\n(e.g, point), and struggles to maintain temporal consistency as the segmenting\nprocess is often decoupled from the initial language grounding. To overcome\nthese fundamental limitations, we propose FlowRVS, a novel framework that\nreconceptualizes RVOS as a conditional continuous flow problem. This allows us\nto harness the inherent strengths of pretrained T2V models, fine-grained pixel\ncontrol, text-video semantic alignment, and temporal coherence. Instead of\nconventional generating from noise to mask or directly predicting mask, we\nreformulate the task by learning a direct, language-guided deformation from a\nvideo's holistic representation to its target mask. Our one-stage, generative\napproach achieves new state-of-the-art results across all major RVOS\nbenchmarks. Specifically, achieving a J&F of 51.1 in\nMeViS (+1.6 over prior SOTA) and 73.3 in the zero shot Ref-DAVIS17 (+2.7),\ndemonstrating the significant potential of modeling video understanding tasks\nas continuous deformation processes.",

However, this cascaded design creates an\ninformation bottleneck by simplifying semantics into coarse geometric prompts\n(e.g, point), and struggles to maintain temporal consistency as the segmenting\nprocess is often decoupled from the initial language grounding. To overcome\nthese fundamental limitations, we propose FlowRVS, a novel framework that\nreconceptualizes RVOS as a conditional continuous flow problem. This allows us\nto harness the inherent strengths of pretrained T2V models, fine-grained pixel\ncontrol, text-video semantic alignment, and temporal coherence. Instead of\nconventional generating from noise to mask or directly predicting mask, we\nreformulate the task by learning a direct, language-guided deformation from a\nvideo's holistic representation to its target mask. Our one-stage, generative\napproach achieves new state-of-the-art results across all major RVOS\nbenchmarks. Specifically, achieving a J&F of 51.1 in\nMeViS (+1.6 over prior SOTA) and 73.3 in the zero shot Ref-DAVIS17 (+2.7),\ndemonstrating the significant potential of modeling video understanding tasks\nas continuous deformation processes.",
