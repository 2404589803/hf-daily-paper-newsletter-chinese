Among these domains, mathematical reasoning serves as a representative\nbenchmark as it requires precise multi-step logic and abstract reasoning, which\ncan be generalized to other tasks. While closed-source RLMs such as GPT-o3\ndemonstrate impressive reasoning capabilities, their proprietary nature limits\ntransparency and reproducibility. Although many open-source projects aim to\nclose this gap, most of them lack sufficient openness by omitting critical\nresources such as datasets and detailed training configurations, which hinders\nreproducibility. To contribute toward greater transparency in RLM development,\nwe introduce the MiroMind-M1 series, a set of fully open-source RLMs built on\nthe Qwen-2.5 backbone that match or exceed the performance of existing\nopen-source RLMs. Specifically, our models are trained in two stages: SFT on a\ncarefully curated corpus of 719K math-reasoning problems with verified CoT\ntrajectories, followed by RLVR on 62K challenging and verifiable problems. To\nenhance the robustness and efficiency of the RLVR process, we introduce\nContext-Aware Multi-Stage Policy Optimization, an algorithm that integrates\nlength-progressive training with an adaptive repetition penalty to encourage\ncontext-aware RL training. Our model achieves state-of-the-art or competitive\nperformance and superior token efficiency among Qwen-2.5-based open-source 7B\nand 32B models on the AIME24, AIME25, and MATH benchmarks.

This study presents a theoretical and empirical\ninvestigation that provides fresh insights into the potential limits of RLVR.\nFirst, we offer a new theoretical perspective that RLVR is constrained by the\nbase model's support-unable to sample solutions with zero initial\nprobability-and operates as a conservative reweighting mechanism that may\nrestrict the discovery of entirely original solutions.

Extensive empirical experiments validate that while\nRLVR consistently improves pass@1, the shrinkage of empirical support generally\noutweighs the expansion of empirical support under larger sampling budgets,\nfailing to recover correct answers that were previously accessible to the base\nmodel.

Despite notable\nadvances with recent efforts, current techniques still lag behind human\ncapabilities in handling drastic visual variations, occlusions, and complex\nscene changes. This limitation arises from their reliance on appearance\nmatching, neglecting the human-like conceptual understanding of objects that\nenables robust identification across temporal dynamics. Motivated by this gap,\nwe propose Segment Concept (SeC), a concept-driven segmentation framework that\nshifts from conventional feature matching to the progressive construction and\nutilization of high-level, object-centric representations. SeC employs Large\nVision-Language Models (LVLMs) to integrate visual cues across diverse frames,\nconstructing robust conceptual priors. During inference, SeC forms a\ncomprehensive semantic representation of the target based on processed frames,\nrealizing robust segmentation of follow-up frames. Furthermore, SeC adaptively\nbalances LVLM-based semantic reasoning with enhanced feature matching,\ndynamically adjusting computational efforts based on scene complexity. To\nrigorously assess VOS methods in scenarios demanding high-level conceptual\nreasoning and robust semantic understanding, we introduce the Semantic Complex\nScenarios Video Object Segmentation benchmark (SeCVOS). SeCVOS comprises 160\nmanually annotated multi-scenario videos designed to challenge models with\nsubstantial appearance variations and dynamic scene transformations. In\nparticular, SeC achieves an 11.8-point improvement over SAM 2.1 on SeCVOS,\nestablishing a new state-of-the-art in concept-aware video object segmentation.",

The\napplication to inverse rendering still faces several challenges, as the\ndiscrete nature of Gaussian primitives makes it difficult to apply geometry\nconstraints. Recent works introduce the signed distance field (SDF) as an extra\ncontinuous representation to regularize the geometry defined by Gaussian\nprimitives. It improves the decomposition quality, at the cost of increasing\nmemory usage and complicating training. Unlike these works, we introduce a\ndiscretized SDF to represent the continuous SDF in a discrete manner by\nencoding it within each Gaussian using a sampled value. This approach allows us\nto link the SDF with the Gaussian opacity through an SDF-to-opacity\ntransformation, enabling rendering the SDF via splatting and avoiding the\ncomputational cost of ray marching.The key challenge is to regularize the\ndiscrete samples to be consistent with the underlying SDF, as the discrete\nrepresentation can hardly apply the gradient-based constraints (\\eg Eikonal\nloss). For this, we project Gaussians onto the zero-level set of SDF and\nenforce alignment with the surface from splatting, namely a projection-based\nconsistency loss. Thanks to the discretized SDF, our method achieves higher\nrelighting quality, while requiring no extra memory beyond GS and avoiding\ncomplex manually designed optimization.

However, previous RLVR algorithms often apply uniform training\nsignals to all tokens, without considering the different roles of low-entropy\nknowledge-related tokens and high-entropy reasoning-related tokens. Some recent\nmethods try to separate these token types by gradient masking or asynchronous\nupdates, but these approaches may break semantic dependencies in the model\noutput and hinder effective learning. In this work, we propose Archer, an\nentropy-aware RLVR approach with dual-token constraints and synchronous\nupdates. Specifically, our method applies weaker KL regularization and higher\nclipping thresholds to reasoning tokens to encourage exploration, while using\nstronger constraints on knowledge tokens to maintain factual knowledge.\nExperimental results on several mathematical reasoning and code generation\nbenchmarks show that our approach significantly outperforms previous RLVR\nmethods, reaching or exceeding state-of-the-art performance among models of\ncomparable size.

      "summary": "Cross-view localization, the task of estimating a camera's\n3-degrees-of-freedom (3-DoF) pose by aligning ground-level images with\nsatellite images, is crucial for large-scale outdoor applications like\nautonomous navigation and augmented reality. Existing methods often rely on\nfully supervised learning, which requires costly ground-truth pose annotations.\nIn this work, we propose GeoDistill, a Geometry guided weakly supervised self\ndistillation framework that uses teacher-student learning with Field-of-View\n(FoV)-based masking to enhance local feature learning for robust cross-view\nlocalization. In GeoDistill, the teacher model localizes a panoramic image,\nwhile the student model predicts locations from a limited FoV counterpart\ncreated by FoV-based masking. By aligning the student's predictions with those\nof the teacher, the student focuses on key features like lane lines and ignores\ntextureless regions, such as roads. This results in more accurate predictions\nand reduced uncertainty, regardless of whether the query images are panoramas\nor limited FoV images. Our experiments show that GeoDistill significantly\nimproves localization performance across different frameworks. Additionally, we\nintroduce a novel orientation estimation network that predicts relative\norientation without requiring precise planar position ground truth. GeoDistill\nprovides a scalable and efficient solution for real-world cross-view\nlocalization challenges. Code and model can be found at\nhttps://github.com/tongshw/GeoDistill.",
