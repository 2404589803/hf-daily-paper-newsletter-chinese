      "summary": "We present LongLive, a frame-level autoregressive (AR) framework for\nreal-time and interactive long video generation. Long video generation presents\nchallenges in both efficiency and quality. Diffusion and Diffusion-Forcing\nmodels can produce high-quality videos but suffer from low efficiency due to\nbidirectional attention. Causal attention AR models support KV caching for\nfaster inference, but often degrade in quality on long videos due to memory\nchallenges during long-video training. In addition, beyond static prompt-based\ngeneration, interactive capabilities, such as streaming prompt inputs, are\ncritical for dynamic content creation, enabling users to guide narratives in\nreal time. This interactive requirement significantly increases complexity,\nespecially in ensuring visual consistency and semantic coherence during prompt\ntransitions. To address these challenges, LongLive adopts a causal, frame-level\nAR design that integrates a KV-recache mechanism that refreshes cached states\nwith new prompts for smooth, adherent switches; streaming long tuning to enable\nlong video training and to align training and inference (train-long-test-long);\nand short window attention paired with a frame-level attention sink, shorten as\nframe sink, preserving long-range consistency while enabling faster generation.\nWith these key designs, LongLive fine-tunes a 1.3B-parameter short-clip model\nto minute-long generation in just 32 GPU-days. At inference, LongLive sustains\n20.7 FPS on a single NVIDIA H100, achieves strong performance on VBench in both\nshort and long videos. LongLive supports up to 240-second videos on a single\nH100 GPU. LongLive further supports INT8-quantized inference with only marginal\nquality loss.",

In the first stage, the model performs efficient layout\nanalysis on downsampled images to identify structural elements, circumventing\nthe computational overhead of processing high-resolution inputs. In the second\nstage, guided by the global layout, it performs targeted content recognition on\nnative-resolution crops extracted from the original image, preserving\nfine-grained details in dense text, complex formulas, and tables. To support\nthis strategy, we developed a comprehensive data engine that generates diverse,\nlarge-scale training corpora for both pretraining and fine-tuning. Ultimately,\nMinerU2.5 demonstrates strong document parsing ability, achieving\nstate-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, surpassing both\ngeneral-purpose and domain-specific models across various recognition tasks,\nwhile maintaining significantly lower computational overhead.",

      "summary": "Autonomous agents have recently achieved remarkable progress across diverse\ndomains, yet most evaluations focus on short-horizon, fully observable tasks.\nIn contrast, many critical real-world tasks, such as large-scale software\ndevelopment, commercial investment, and scientific discovery, unfold in\nlong-horizon and partially observable scenarios where success hinges on\nsustained reasoning, planning, memory management, and tool use. Existing\nbenchmarks rarely capture these long-horizon challenges, leaving a gap in\nsystematic evaluation. To bridge this gap, we introduce UltraHorizon a\nnovel benchmark that measures the foundational capabilities essential for\ncomplex real-world challenges. We use exploration as a unifying task across\nthree distinct environments to validate these core competencies. Agents are\ndesigned in long-horizon discovery tasks where they must iteratively uncover\nhidden rules through sustained reasoning, planning, memory and tools\nmanagement, and interaction with environments. Under the heaviest scale\nsetting, trajectories average 200k+ tokens and 400+ tool\ncalls, whereas in standard configurations they still exceed 35k tokens\nand involve more than 60 tool calls on average. Our extensive\nexperiments reveal that LLM-agents consistently underperform in these settings,\nwhereas human participants achieve higher scores, underscoring a persistent gap\nin agents' long-horizon abilities. We also observe that simple scaling fails in\nour task. To better illustrate the failure of agents, we conduct an in-depth\nanalysis of collected trajectories. We identify eight types of errors and\nattribute them to two primary causes: in-context locking and functional\nfundamental capability gaps.\nhttps://github.com/StarDewXXX/UltraHorizon{Our code will be available\nhere.}",

    "summary": "Autonomous agents have recently achieved remarkable progress across diverse\ndomains, yet most evaluations focus on short-horizon, fully observable tasks.\nIn contrast, many critical real-world tasks, such as large-scale software\ndevelopment, commercial investment, and scientific discovery, unfold in\nlong-horizon and partially observable scenarios where success hinges on\nsustained reasoning, planning, memory management, and tool use. Existing\nbenchmarks rarely capture these long-horizon challenges, leaving a gap in\nsystematic evaluation. To bridge this gap, we introduce UltraHorizon a\nnovel benchmark that measures the foundational capabilities essential for\ncomplex real-world challenges. We use exploration as a unifying task across\nthree distinct environments to validate these core competencies. Agents are\ndesigned in long-horizon discovery tasks where they must iteratively uncover\nhidden rules through sustained reasoning, planning, memory and tools\nmanagement, and interaction with environments. Under the heaviest scale\nsetting, trajectories average 200k+ tokens and 400+ tool\ncalls, whereas in standard configurations they still exceed 35k tokens\nand involve more than 60 tool calls on average. Our extensive\nexperiments reveal that LLM-agents consistently underperform in these settings,\nwhereas human participants achieve higher scores, underscoring a persistent gap\nin agents' long-horizon abilities. We also observe that simple scaling fails in\nour task. To better illustrate the failure of agents, we conduct an in-depth\nanalysis of collected trajectories. We identify eight types of errors and\nattribute them to two primary causes: in-context locking and functional\nfundamental capability gaps.\nhttps://github.com/StarDewXXX/UltraHorizon{Our code will be available\nhere.}",

      "summary": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Graph-based RAG has become the\nimportant paradigm for enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) with external\nknowledge. However, existing approaches face a fundamental trade-off. While\ngraph-based methods are inherently dependent on high-quality graph structures,\nthey face significant practical constraints: manually constructed knowledge\ngraphs are prohibitively expensive to scale, while automatically extracted\ngraphs from corpora are limited by the performance of the underlying LLM\nextractors, especially when using smaller, local-deployed models. This paper\npresents Think-on-Graph 3.0 (ToG-3), a novel framework that introduces\nMulti-Agent Context Evolution and Retrieval (MACER) mechanism to overcome these\nlimitations. Our core innovation is the dynamic construction and refinement of\na Chunk-Triplets-Community heterogeneous graph index, which pioneeringly\nincorporates a dual-evolution mechanism of Evolving Query and Evolving\nSub-Graph for precise evidence retrieval. This approach addresses a critical\nlimitation of prior Graph-based RAG methods, which typically construct a static\ngraph index in a single pass without adapting to the actual query. A\nmulti-agent system, comprising Constructor, Retriever, Reflector, and Responser\nagents, collaboratively engages in an iterative process of evidence retrieval,\nanswer generation, sufficiency reflection, and, crucially, evolving query and\nsubgraph. This dual-evolving multi-agent system allows ToG-3 to adaptively\nbuild a targeted graph index during reasoning, mitigating the inherent\ndrawbacks of static, one-time graph construction and enabling deep, precise\nreasoning even with lightweight LLMs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nToG-3 outperforms compared baselines on both deep and broad reasoning\nbenchmarks, and ablation studies confirm the efficacy of the components of\nMACER framework.",

While\ngraph-based methods are inherently dependent on high-quality graph structures,\nthey face significant practical constraints: manually constructed knowledge\ngraphs are prohibitively expensive to scale, while automatically extracted\ngraphs from corpora are limited by the performance of the underlying LLM\nextractors, especially when using smaller, local-deployed models. This paper\npresents Think-on-Graph 3.0 (ToG-3), a novel framework that introduces\nMulti-Agent Context Evolution and Retrieval (MACER) mechanism to overcome these\nlimitations. Our core innovation is the dynamic construction and refinement of\na Chunk-Triplets-Community heterogeneous graph index, which pioneeringly\nincorporates a dual-evolution mechanism of Evolving Query and Evolving\nSub-Graph for precise evidence retrieval. This approach addresses a critical\nlimitation of prior Graph-based RAG methods, which typically construct a static\ngraph index in a single pass without adapting to the actual query. A\nmulti-agent system, comprising Constructor, Retriever, Reflector, and Responser\nagents, collaboratively engages in an iterative process of evidence retrieval,\nanswer generation, sufficiency reflection, and, crucially, evolving query and\nsubgraph. This dual-evolving multi-agent system allows ToG-3 to adaptively\nbuild a targeted graph index during reasoning, mitigating the inherent\ndrawbacks of static, one-time graph construction and enabling deep, precise\nreasoning even with lightweight LLMs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nToG-3 outperforms compared baselines on both deep and broad reasoning\nbenchmarks, and ablation studies confirm the efficacy of the components of\nMACER framework.",

      "summary": "Reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) often suffers from reward\nover-optimization, where a policy model hacks the reward signals to achieve\nhigh scores while producing low-quality outputs. Our theoretical analysis shows\nthat the key lies in reward misspecification at the high-reward tail: the\ninability to reliably distinguish Excellent responses from merely Great ones.\nThis motivate us to focus on the high-reward region. However, such tail\nexamples are scarce under the base LLM.

    "summary": "Reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) often suffers from reward\nover-optimization, where a policy model hacks the reward signals to achieve\nhigh scores while producing low-quality outputs. Our theoretical analysis shows\nthat the key lies in reward misspecification at the high-reward tail: the\ninability to reliably distinguish Excellent responses from merely Great ones.\nThis motivate us to focus on the high-reward region. However, such tail\nexamples are scarce under the base LLM. While off-policy exemplars (e.g. from\nstronger models or rewrites) are easier to obtain, naively training on them\nyields a misspecified reward for the policy we aim to align.

In contrast, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) such as linear\nattention and state space models have gained popularity due to their constant\nper-token complexities. However, these recurrent models struggle with tasks\nthat require accurate recall of contextual information from long contexts,\nbecause all contextual information is compressed into a constant-size recurrent\nstate. Previous works have shown that recall ability is positively correlated\nwith the recurrent state size, yet directly training RNNs with larger recurrent\nstates results in high training costs. In this paper, we introduce StateX, a\ntraining pipeline for efficiently expanding the states of pre-trained RNNs\nthrough post-training. For two popular classes of RNNs, linear attention and\nstate space models, we design post-training architectural modifications to\nscale up the state size with no or negligible increase in model parameters.\nExperiments on models up to 1.3B parameters demonstrate that StateX efficiently\nenhances the recall and in-context learning ability of RNNs without incurring\nhigh post-training costs or compromising other capabilities.",

      "summary": "Humans develop an understanding of intuitive physics through active\ninteraction with the world. This approach is in stark contrast to current video\nmodels, such as Sora, which rely on passive observation and therefore struggle\nwith grasping physical causality. This observation leads to our central\nhypothesis: authentic physical intuition of the world model must be grounded in\nextensive, causally rich interactions with the real world. To test this\nhypothesis, we present WoW, a 14-billion-parameter generative world model\ntrained on 2 million robot interaction trajectories. Our findings reveal that\nthe model's understanding of physics is a probabilistic distribution of\nplausible outcomes, leading to stochastic instabilities and physical\nhallucinations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this emergent capability can\nbe actively constrained toward physical realism by SOPHIA, where\nvision-language model agents evaluate the DiT-generated output and guide its\nrefinement by iteratively evolving the language instructions. In addition, a\nco-trained Inverse Dynamics Model translates these refined plans into\nexecutable robotic actions, thus closing the imagination-to-action loop. We\nestablish WoWBench, a new benchmark focused on physical consistency and causal\nreasoning in video, where WoW achieves state-of-the-art performance in both\nhuman and autonomous evaluation, demonstrating strong ability in physical\ncausality, collision dynamics, and object permanence. Our work provides\nsystematic evidence that large-scale, real-world interaction is a cornerstone\nfor developing physical intuition in AI. Models, data, and benchmarks will be\nopen-sourced.",
