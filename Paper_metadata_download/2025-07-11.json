      "summary": "Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown\nremarkable capabilities in integrating vision and language for complex\nreasoning. While most existing benchmarks evaluate models under offline\nsettings with a fixed set of pre-recorded inputs, we introduce OST-Bench, a\nbenchmark designed to evaluate Online Spatio-Temporal understanding from the\nperspective of an agent actively exploring a scene. The Online aspect\nemphasizes the need to process and reason over incrementally acquired\nobservations, while the Spatio-Temporal component requires integrating current\nvisual inputs with historical memory to support dynamic spatial reasoning.\nOST-Bench better reflects the challenges of real-world embodied perception.\nBuilt on an efficient data collection pipeline, OST-Bench consists of 1.4k\nscenes and 10k question-answer pairs collected from ScanNet, Matterport3D, and\nARKitScenes. We evaluate several leading MLLMs on OST-Bench and observe that\nthey fall short on tasks requiring complex spatio-temporal reasoning. Under the\nonline setting, their accuracy declines as the exploration horizon extends and\nthe memory grows. Through further experimental analysis, we identify common\nerror patterns across models and find that both complex clue-based spatial\nreasoning demands and long-term memory retrieval requirements significantly\ndrop model performance along two separate axes, highlighting the core\nchallenges that must be addressed to improve online embodied reasoning. To\nfoster further research and development in the field, our codes, dataset, and\nbenchmark are available. Our project page is:\nhttps://rbler1234.github.io/OSTBench.github.io/",

    "title": "OST-Bench: Evaluating the Capabilities of MLLMs in Online\n  Spatio-temporal Scene Understanding",
    "summary": "Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown\nremarkable capabilities in integrating vision and language for complex\nreasoning. While most existing benchmarks evaluate models under offline\nsettings with a fixed set of pre-recorded inputs, we introduce OST-Bench, a\nbenchmark designed to evaluate Online Spatio-Temporal understanding from the\nperspective of an agent actively exploring a scene. The Online aspect\nemphasizes the need to process and reason over incrementally acquired\nobservations, while the Spatio-Temporal component requires integrating current\nvisual inputs with historical memory to support dynamic spatial reasoning.\nOST-Bench better reflects the challenges of real-world embodied perception.\nBuilt on an efficient data collection pipeline, OST-Bench consists of 1.4k\nscenes and 10k question-answer pairs collected from ScanNet, Matterport3D, and\nARKitScenes. We evaluate several leading MLLMs on OST-Bench and observe that\nthey fall short on tasks requiring complex spatio-temporal reasoning. Under the\nonline setting, their accuracy declines as the exploration horizon extends and\nthe memory grows. Through further experimental analysis, we identify common\nerror patterns across models and find that both complex clue-based spatial\nreasoning demands and long-term memory retrieval requirements significantly\ndrop model performance along two separate axes, highlighting the core\nchallenges that must be addressed to improve online embodied reasoning. To\nfoster further research and development in the field, our codes, dataset, and\nbenchmark are available. Our project page is:\nhttps://rbler1234.github.io/OSTBench.github.io/",

      "summary": "In this paper, we introduce LangSplatV2, which achieves high-dimensional\nfeature splatting at 476.2 FPS and 3D open-vocabulary text querying at 384.6\nFPS for high-resolution images, providing a 42 times speedup and a 47\ntimes boost over LangSplat respectively, along with improved query accuracy.\nLangSplat employs Gaussian Splatting to embed 2D CLIP language features into\n3D, significantly enhancing speed and learning a precise 3D language field with\nSAM semantics. Such advancements in 3D language fields are crucial for\napplications that require language interaction within complex scenes. However,\nLangSplat does not yet achieve real-time inference performance (8.2 FPS), even\nwith advanced A100 GPUs, severely limiting its broader application. In this\npaper, we first conduct a detailed time analysis of LangSplat, identifying the\nheavyweight decoder as the primary speed bottleneck.

    "title": "LangSplatV2: High-dimensional 3D Language Gaussian Splatting with 450+\n  FPS",
    "summary": "In this paper, we introduce LangSplatV2, which achieves high-dimensional\nfeature splatting at 476.2 FPS and 3D open-vocabulary text querying at 384.6\nFPS for high-resolution images, providing a 42 times speedup and a 47\ntimes boost over LangSplat respectively, along with improved query accuracy.\nLangSplat employs Gaussian Splatting to embed 2D CLIP language features into\n3D, significantly enhancing speed and learning a precise 3D language field with\nSAM semantics. Such advancements in 3D language fields are crucial for\napplications that require language interaction within complex scenes. However,\nLangSplat does not yet achieve real-time inference performance (8.2 FPS), even\nwith advanced A100 GPUs, severely limiting its broader application. In this\npaper, we first conduct a detailed time analysis of LangSplat, identifying the\nheavyweight decoder as the primary speed bottleneck.

Notably, STTM achieves a\n2times speed-up with only a 0.5% accuracy drop under a 50% token budget, and\na 3times speed-up with just a 2% drop under a 30% budget.
