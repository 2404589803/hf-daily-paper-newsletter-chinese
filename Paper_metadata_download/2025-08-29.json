      "summary": "Existing literature typically treats style-driven and subject-driven\ngeneration as two disjoint tasks: the former prioritizes stylistic similarity,\nwhereas the latter insists on subject consistency, resulting in an apparent\nantagonism. We argue that both objectives can be unified under a single\nframework because they ultimately concern the disentanglement and\nre-composition of content and style, a long-standing theme in style-driven\nresearch. To this end, we present USO, a Unified Style-Subject Optimized\ncustomization model. First, we construct a large-scale triplet dataset\nconsisting of content images, style images, and their corresponding stylized\ncontent images. Second, we introduce a disentangled learning scheme that\nsimultaneously aligns style features and disentangles content from style\nthrough two complementary objectives, style-alignment training and\ncontent-style disentanglement training. Third, we incorporate a style\nreward-learning paradigm denoted as SRL to further enhance the model's\nperformance. Finally, we release USO-Bench, the first benchmark that jointly\nevaluates style similarity and subject fidelity across multiple metrics.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that USO achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance among open-source models along both dimensions of subject\nconsistency and style similarity.

    "title": "USO: Unified Style and Subject-Driven Generation via Disentangled and\n  Reward Learning",
    "summary": "Existing literature typically treats style-driven and subject-driven\ngeneration as two disjoint tasks: the former prioritizes stylistic similarity,\nwhereas the latter insists on subject consistency, resulting in an apparent\nantagonism. We argue that both objectives can be unified under a single\nframework because they ultimately concern the disentanglement and\nre-composition of content and style, a long-standing theme in style-driven\nresearch. To this end, we present USO, a Unified Style-Subject Optimized\ncustomization model. First, we construct a large-scale triplet dataset\nconsisting of content images, style images, and their corresponding stylized\ncontent images. Second, we introduce a disentangled learning scheme that\nsimultaneously aligns style features and disentangles content from style\nthrough two complementary objectives, style-alignment training and\ncontent-style disentanglement training. Third, we incorporate a style\nreward-learning paradigm denoted as SRL to further enhance the model's\nperformance. Finally, we release USO-Bench, the first benchmark that jointly\nevaluates style similarity and subject fidelity across multiple metrics.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that USO achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance among open-source models along both dimensions of subject\nconsistency and style similarity.

      "summary": "Long video generation is fundamentally a long context memory problem: models\nmust retain and retrieve salient events across a long range without collapsing\nor drifting. However, scaling diffusion transformers to generate long-context\nvideos is fundamentally limited by the quadratic cost of self-attention, which\nmakes memory and computation intractable and difficult to optimize for long\nsequences. We recast long-context video generation as an internal information\nretrieval task and propose a simple, learnable sparse attention routing module,\nMixture of Contexts (MoC), as an effective long-term memory retrieval engine.\nIn MoC, each query dynamically selects a few informative chunks plus mandatory\nanchors (caption, local windows) to attend to, with causal routing that\nprevents loop closures. As we scale the data and gradually sparsify the\nrouting, the model allocates compute to salient history, preserving identities,\nactions, and scenes over minutes of content. Efficiency follows as a byproduct\nof retrieval (near-linear scaling), which enables practical training and\nsynthesis, and the emergence of memory and consistency at the scale of minutes.",

    "title": "Mixture of Contexts for Long Video Generation",
    "summary": "Long video generation is fundamentally a long context memory problem: models\nmust retain and retrieve salient events across a long range without collapsing\nor drifting. However, scaling diffusion transformers to generate long-context\nvideos is fundamentally limited by the quadratic cost of self-attention, which\nmakes memory and computation intractable and difficult to optimize for long\nsequences. We recast long-context video generation as an internal information\nretrieval task and propose a simple, learnable sparse attention routing module,\nMixture of Contexts (MoC), as an effective long-term memory retrieval engine.\nIn MoC, each query dynamically selects a few informative chunks plus mandatory\nanchors (caption, local windows) to attend to, with causal routing that\nprevents loop closures. As we scale the data and gradually sparsify the\nrouting, the model allocates compute to salient history, preserving identities,\nactions, and scenes over minutes of content. Efficiency follows as a byproduct\nof retrieval (near-linear scaling), which enables practical training and\nsynthesis, and the emergence of memory and consistency at the scale of minutes.",

ROSI operates as a simple,\nfine-tuning-free rank-one weight modification applied to all residual stream\nwrite matrices. The required safety direction can be computed from a small set\nof harmful and harmless instruction pairs. We show that ROSI consistently\nincreases safety refusal rates - as evaluated by Llama Guard 3 - while\npreserving the utility of the model on standard benchmarks such as MMLU,\nHellaSwag, and Arc. Furthermore, we show that ROSI can also re-align\n'uncensored' models by amplifying their own latent safety directions,\ndemonstrating its utility as an effective last-mile safety procedure.

Specifically, 1) TriMM\nfirst introduces collaborative multi-modal coding, which integrates\nmodality-specific features while preserving their unique representational\nstrengths. 2) Furthermore, auxiliary 2D and 3D supervision are introduced to\nraise the robustness and performance of multi-modal coding. 3) Based on the\nembedded multi-modal code, TriMM employs a triplane latent diffusion model to\ngenerate 3D assets of superior quality, enhancing both the texture and the\ngeometric detail. Extensive experiments on multiple well-known datasets\ndemonstrate that TriMM, by effectively leveraging multi-modality, achieves\ncompetitive performance with models trained on large-scale datasets, despite\nutilizing a small amount of training data.
