      "summary": "We tackle the task of long-form music generation--particularly the\nchallenging lyrics-to-song problem--by introducing YuE, a family of\nopen foundation models based on the LLaMA2 architecture. Specifically, YuE\nscales to trillions of tokens and generates up to five minutes of music while\nmaintaining lyrical alignment, coherent musical structure, and engaging vocal\nmelodies with appropriate accompaniment. It achieves this through (1)\ntrack-decoupled next-token prediction to overcome dense mixture signals, (2)\nstructural progressive conditioning for long-context lyrical alignment, and (3)\na multitask, multiphase pre-training recipe to converge and generalize. In\naddition, we redesign the in-context learning technique for music generation,\nenabling versatile style transfer (e.g., converting Japanese city pop into an\nEnglish rap while preserving the original accompaniment) and bidirectional\ngeneration. Through extensive evaluation, we demonstrate that YuE matches or\neven surpasses some of the proprietary systems in musicality and vocal agility.\nIn addition, fine-tuning YuE enables additional controls and enhanced support\nfor tail languages. Furthermore, beyond generation, we show that YuE's learned\nrepresentations can perform well on music understanding tasks, where the\nresults of YuE match or exceed state-of-the-art methods on the MARBLE\nbenchmark.

This often results in artificial intelligence (AI) models that\nfail to capture SEA cultural nuances. To fill this gap, we present SEA-VL, an\nopen-source initiative dedicated to developing high-quality, culturally\nrelevant data for SEA languages. By involving contributors from SEA countries,\nSEA-VL aims to ensure better cultural relevance and diversity, fostering\ngreater inclusivity of underrepresented languages in VL research. Beyond\ncrowdsourcing, our initiative goes one step further in the exploration of the\nautomatic collection of culturally relevant images through crawling and image\ngeneration. First, we find that image crawling achieves approximately ~85%\ncultural relevance while being more cost- and time-efficient than\ncrowdsourcing. Second, despite the substantial progress in generative vision\nmodels, synthetic images remain unreliable in accurately reflecting SEA\ncultures. The generated images often fail to reflect the nuanced traditions and\ncultural contexts of the region. Collectively, we gather 1.28M SEA\nculturally-relevant images, more than 50 times larger than other existing\ndatasets. Through SEA-VL, we aim to bridge the representation gap in SEA,\nfostering the development of more inclusive AI systems that authentically\nrepresent diverse cultures across SEA.",

Beyond\ncrowdsourcing, our initiative goes one step further in the exploration of the\nautomatic collection of culturally relevant images through crawling and image\ngeneration. First, we find that image crawling achieves approximately ~85%\ncultural relevance while being more cost- and time-efficient than\ncrowdsourcing. Second, despite the substantial progress in generative vision\nmodels, synthetic images remain unreliable in accurately reflecting SEA\ncultures. The generated images often fail to reflect the nuanced traditions and\ncultural contexts of the region. Collectively, we gather 1.28M SEA\nculturally-relevant images, more than 50 times larger than other existing\ndatasets. Through SEA-VL, we aim to bridge the representation gap in SEA,\nfostering the development of more inclusive AI systems that authentically\nrepresent diverse cultures across SEA.",

      "summary": "Enhancing reasoning in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) faces unique challenges\nfrom the complex interplay between visual perception and logical reasoning,\nparticularly in compact 3B-parameter architectures where architectural\nconstraints limit reasoning capacity and modality alignment.\n  While rule-based reinforcement learning (RL) excels in text-only domains, its\nmultimodal extension confronts two critical barriers: (1) data limitations due\nto ambiguous answers and scarce complex reasoning examples, and (2) degraded\nfoundational reasoning induced by multimodal pretraining.\n  To address these challenges, we propose \\method, a two-stage\nframework adapting rule-based RL for multimodal reasoning through\nFoundational Reasoning Enhancement (FRE) followed by\nMultimodal Generalization Training (MGT). The FRE stage first\nstrengthens reasoning abilities using text-only data with rule-based RL, then\nthe MGT stage generalizes these reasoning capabilities to multimodal domains.\n  Experiments on Qwen2.5-VL-Instruct-3B demonstrate that \\method achieves\n4.83\\% and 4.5\\% average improvements over baselines in multimodal and\ntext-only benchmarks, respectively, with a 3.63\\% gain in complex Football Game\ntasks. These results validate that text-based reasoning enhancement enables\neffective multimodal generalization, offering a data-efficient paradigm that\nbypasses costly high-quality multimodal training data.",

    "summary": "Enhancing reasoning in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) faces unique challenges\nfrom the complex interplay between visual perception and logical reasoning,\nparticularly in compact 3B-parameter architectures where architectural\nconstraints limit reasoning capacity and modality alignment.\n  While rule-based reinforcement learning (RL) excels in text-only domains, its\nmultimodal extension confronts two critical barriers: (1) data limitations due\nto ambiguous answers and scarce complex reasoning examples, and (2) degraded\nfoundational reasoning induced by multimodal pretraining.\n  To address these challenges, we propose \\method, a two-stage\nframework adapting rule-based RL for multimodal reasoning through\nFoundational Reasoning Enhancement (FRE) followed by\nMultimodal Generalization Training (MGT). The FRE stage first\nstrengthens reasoning abilities using text-only data with rule-based RL, then\nthe MGT stage generalizes these reasoning capabilities to multimodal domains.\n  Experiments on Qwen2.5-VL-Instruct-3B demonstrate that \\method achieves\n4.83\\% and 4.5\\% average improvements over baselines in multimodal and\ntext-only benchmarks, respectively, with a 3.63\\% gain in complex Football Game\ntasks. These results validate that text-based reasoning enhancement enables\neffective multimodal generalization, offering a data-efficient paradigm that\nbypasses costly high-quality multimodal training data.",

      "summary": "While recent advancements in text-to-video diffusion models enable\nhigh-quality short video generation from a single prompt, generating real-world\nlong videos in a single pass remains challenging due to limited data and high\ncomputational costs. To address this, several works propose tuning-free\napproaches, i.e., extending existing models for long video generation,\nspecifically using multiple prompts to allow for dynamic and controlled content\nchanges. However, these methods primarily focus on ensuring smooth transitions\nbetween adjacent frames, often leading to content drift and a gradual loss of\nsemantic coherence over longer sequences. To tackle such an issue, we propose\nSynchronized Coupled Sampling (SynCoS), a novel inference framework that\nsynchronizes denoising paths across the entire video, ensuring long-range\nconsistency across both adjacent and distant frames. Our approach combines two\ncomplementary sampling strategies: reverse and optimization-based sampling,\nwhich ensure seamless local transitions and enforce global coherence,\nrespectively. However, directly alternating between these samplings misaligns\ndenoising trajectories, disrupting prompt guidance and introducing unintended\ncontent changes as they operate independently. To resolve this, SynCoS\nsynchronizes them through a grounded timestep and a fixed baseline noise,\nensuring fully coupled sampling with aligned denoising paths. Extensive\nexperiments show that SynCoS significantly improves multi-event long video\ngeneration, achieving smoother transitions and superior long-range coherence,\noutperforming previous approaches both quantitatively and qualitatively.",

To address this, several works propose tuning-free\napproaches, i.e., extending existing models for long video generation,\nspecifically using multiple prompts to allow for dynamic and controlled content\nchanges. However, these methods primarily focus on ensuring smooth transitions\nbetween adjacent frames, often leading to content drift and a gradual loss of\nsemantic coherence over longer sequences. To tackle such an issue, we propose\nSynchronized Coupled Sampling (SynCoS), a novel inference framework that\nsynchronizes denoising paths across the entire video, ensuring long-range\nconsistency across both adjacent and distant frames. Our approach combines two\ncomplementary sampling strategies: reverse and optimization-based sampling,\nwhich ensure seamless local transitions and enforce global coherence,\nrespectively. However, directly alternating between these samplings misaligns\ndenoising trajectories, disrupting prompt guidance and introducing unintended\ncontent changes as they operate independently. To resolve this, SynCoS\nsynchronizes them through a grounded timestep and a fixed baseline noise,\nensuring fully coupled sampling with aligned denoising paths. Extensive\nexperiments show that SynCoS significantly improves multi-event long video\ngeneration, achieving smoother transitions and superior long-range coherence,\noutperforming previous approaches both quantitatively and qualitatively.",

      "summary": "Recent advances in long video understanding typically mitigate visual\nredundancy through visual token pruning based on attention distribution.\nHowever, while existing methods employ post-hoc low-response token pruning in\ndecoder layers, they overlook the input-level semantic correlation between\nvisual tokens and instructions (query). In this paper, we propose QuoTA, an\nante-hoc training-free modular that extends existing large video-language\nmodels (LVLMs) for visual token assignment based on query-oriented frame-level\nimportance assessment. The query-oriented token selection is crucial as it\naligns visual processing with task-specific requirements, optimizing token\nbudget utilization while preserving semantically relevant content.\nSpecifically, (i) QuoTA strategically allocates frame-level importance scores\nbased on query relevance, enabling one-time visual token assignment before\ncross-modal interactions in decoder layers, (ii) we decouple the query through\nChain-of-Thoughts reasoning to facilitate more precise LVLM-based frame\nimportance scoring, and (iii) QuoTA offers a plug-and-play functionality that\nextends to existing LVLMs. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that\nimplementing QuoTA with LLaVA-Video-7B yields an average performance\nimprovement of 3.2% across six benchmarks (including Video-MME and MLVU) while\noperating within an identical visual token budget as the baseline.

    "title": "QuoTA: Query-oriented Token Assignment via CoT Query Decouple for Long\n  Video Comprehension",
    "summary": "Recent advances in long video understanding typically mitigate visual\nredundancy through visual token pruning based on attention distribution.\nHowever, while existing methods employ post-hoc low-response token pruning in\ndecoder layers, they overlook the input-level semantic correlation between\nvisual tokens and instructions (query). In this paper, we propose QuoTA, an\nante-hoc training-free modular that extends existing large video-language\nmodels (LVLMs) for visual token assignment based on query-oriented frame-level\nimportance assessment. The query-oriented token selection is crucial as it\naligns visual processing with task-specific requirements, optimizing token\nbudget utilization while preserving semantically relevant content.\nSpecifically, (i) QuoTA strategically allocates frame-level importance scores\nbased on query relevance, enabling one-time visual token assignment before\ncross-modal interactions in decoder layers, (ii) we decouple the query through\nChain-of-Thoughts reasoning to facilitate more precise LVLM-based frame\nimportance scoring, and (iii) QuoTA offers a plug-and-play functionality that\nextends to existing LVLMs. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that\nimplementing QuoTA with LLaVA-Video-7B yields an average performance\nimprovement of 3.2% across six benchmarks (including Video-MME and MLVU) while\noperating within an identical visual token budget as the baseline.

      "summary": "Human interaction with the external world fundamentally involves the exchange\nof personal memory, whether with other individuals, websites, applications, or,\nin the future, AI agents. A significant portion of this interaction is\nredundant, requiring users to repeatedly provide the same information across\ndifferent contexts. Existing solutions, such as browser-stored credentials,\nautofill mechanisms, and unified authentication systems, have aimed to mitigate\nthis redundancy by serving as intermediaries that store and retrieve commonly\nused user data. The advent of large language models (LLMs) presents an\nopportunity to redefine memory management through an AI-native paradigm: SECOND\nME. SECOND ME acts as an intelligent, persistent memory offload system that\nretains, organizes, and dynamically utilizes user-specific knowledge. By\nserving as an intermediary in user interactions, it can autonomously generate\ncontext-aware responses, prefill required information, and facilitate seamless\ncommunication with external systems, significantly reducing cognitive load and\ninteraction friction. Unlike traditional memory storage solutions, SECOND ME\nextends beyond static data retention by leveraging LLM-based memory\nparameterization. This enables structured organization, contextual reasoning,\nand adaptive knowledge retrieval, facilitating a more systematic and\nintelligent approach to memory management. As AI-driven personal agents like\nSECOND ME become increasingly integrated into digital ecosystems, SECOND ME\nfurther represents a critical step toward augmenting human-world interaction\nwith persistent, contextually aware, and self-optimizing memory systems.

      "summary": "Privacy concerns around ever increasing number of cameras are increasing in\ntoday's digital age. Although existing anonymization methods are able to\nobscure identity information, they often struggle to preserve the utility of\nthe images. In this work, we introduce a training-free method for face\nanonymization that preserves key non-identity-related attributes. Our approach\nutilizes a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model without requiring\noptimization or training. It begins by inverting the input image to recover its\ninitial noise. The noise is then denoised through an identity-conditioned\ndiffusion process, where modified identity embeddings ensure the anonymized\nface is distinct from the original identity. Our approach also supports\nlocalized anonymization, giving users control over which facial regions are\nanonymized or kept intact. Comprehensive evaluations against state-of-the-art\nmethods show our approach excels in anonymization, attribute preservation, and\nimage quality. Its flexibility, robustness, and practicality make it\nwell-suited for real-world applications. Code and data can be found at\nhttps://github.com/hanweikung/nullface .",
