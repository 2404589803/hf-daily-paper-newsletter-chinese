      "summary": "Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in visual content\ngeneration but remain challenging to deploy due to their high computational\ncost during inference. This computational burden primarily arises from the\nquadratic complexity of self-attention with respect to image or video\nresolution. While existing acceleration methods often compromise output quality\nor necessitate costly retraining, we observe that most diffusion models are\npre-trained at lower resolutions, presenting an opportunity to exploit these\nlow-resolution priors for more efficient inference without degrading\nperformance. In this work, we introduce Bottleneck Sampling, a training-free\nframework that leverages low-resolution priors to reduce computational overhead\nwhile preserving output fidelity. Bottleneck Sampling follows a high-low-high\ndenoising workflow: it performs high-resolution denoising in the initial and\nfinal stages while operating at lower resolutions in intermediate steps. To\nmitigate aliasing and blurring artifacts, we further refine the resolution\ntransition points and adaptively shift the denoising timesteps at each stage.\nWe evaluate Bottleneck Sampling on both image and video generation tasks, where\nextensive experiments demonstrate that it accelerates inference by up to\n3times for image generation and 2.5times for video generation, all while\nmaintaining output quality comparable to the standard full-resolution sampling\nprocess across multiple evaluation metrics.

      "summary": "The integration of geometric reconstruction and generative modeling remains a\ncritical challenge in developing AI systems capable of human-like spatial\nreasoning. This paper proposes Aether, a unified framework that enables\ngeometry-aware reasoning in world models by jointly optimizing three core\ncapabilities: (1) 4D dynamic reconstruction, (2) action-conditioned video\nprediction, and (3) goal-conditioned visual planning. Through task-interleaved\nfeature learning, Aether achieves synergistic knowledge sharing across\nreconstruction, prediction, and planning objectives. Building upon video\ngeneration models, our framework demonstrates unprecedented synthetic-to-real\ngeneralization despite never observing real-world data during training.\nFurthermore, our approach achieves zero-shot generalization in both action\nfollowing and reconstruction tasks, thanks to its intrinsic geometric modeling.\nRemarkably, even without real-world data, its reconstruction performance far\nexceeds that of domain-specific models. Additionally, Aether leverages a\ngeometry-informed action space to seamlessly translate predictions into\nactions, enabling effective autonomous trajectory planning. We hope our work\ninspires the community to explore new frontiers in physically-reasonable world\nmodeling and its applications.",

    "summary": "The integration of geometric reconstruction and generative modeling remains a\ncritical challenge in developing AI systems capable of human-like spatial\nreasoning. This paper proposes Aether, a unified framework that enables\ngeometry-aware reasoning in world models by jointly optimizing three core\ncapabilities: (1) 4D dynamic reconstruction, (2) action-conditioned video\nprediction, and (3) goal-conditioned visual planning. Through task-interleaved\nfeature learning, Aether achieves synergistic knowledge sharing across\nreconstruction, prediction, and planning objectives. Building upon video\ngeneration models, our framework demonstrates unprecedented synthetic-to-real\ngeneralization despite never observing real-world data during training.\nFurthermore, our approach achieves zero-shot generalization in both action\nfollowing and reconstruction tasks, thanks to its intrinsic geometric modeling.\nRemarkably, even without real-world data, its reconstruction performance far\nexceeds that of domain-specific models. Additionally, Aether leverages a\ngeometry-informed action space to seamlessly translate predictions into\nactions, enabling effective autonomous trajectory planning. We hope our work\ninspires the community to explore new frontiers in physically-reasonable world\nmodeling and its applications.",

By decomposing multi-aspect NFQs into single-aspect sub-queries and\naggregating the results, Typed-RAG generates more informative and contextually\nrelevant responses. To evaluate Typed-RAG, we introduce Wiki-NFQA, a benchmark\ndataset covering diverse NFQ types. Experimental results demonstrate that\nTyped-RAG outperforms baselines, thereby highlighting the importance of\ntype-aware decomposition for effective retrieval and generation in NFQA. Our\ncode and dataset are available at\nhttps://github.com/TeamNLP/Typed-RAG{https://github.com/TeamNLP/Typed-RAG}.",

Most prior work prioritizes visual fidelity while overlooking the need\nfor smaller, more efficient models suitable for real-world deployment. To\naddress this challenge, we propose a lightweight T2V framework, termed\nHummingbird, which prunes existing models and enhances visual quality through\nvisual feedback learning. Our approach reduces the size of the U-Net from 1.4\nbillion to 0.7 billion parameters, significantly improving efficiency while\npreserving high-quality video generation.

To support user-driven training and style customization, we\npublicly release the full training code, including data processing and model\ntraining. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves a 31X speedup\ncompared to state-of-the-art models such as VideoCrafter2, while also attaining\nthe highest overall score on VBench. Moreover, our method supports the\ngeneration of videos with up to 26 frames, addressing the limitations of\nexisting U-Net-based methods in long video generation.

      "summary": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a powerful representation for\nreal-time, high-performance rendering, enabling a wide range of applications.\nHowever, representing 3D scenes with numerous explicit Gaussian primitives\nimposes significant storage and memory overhead. Recent studies have shown that\nhigh-quality rendering can be achieved with a substantially reduced number of\nGaussians when represented with high-precision attributes. Nevertheless,\nexisting 3DGS compression methods still rely on a relatively large number of\nGaussians, focusing primarily on attribute compression. This is because a\nsmaller set of Gaussians becomes increasingly sensitive to lossy attribute\ncompression, leading to severe quality degradation. Since the number of\nGaussians is directly tied to computational costs, it is essential to reduce\nthe number of Gaussians effectively rather than only optimizing storage. In\nthis paper, we propose Optimized Minimal Gaussians representation (OMG), which\nsignificantly reduces storage while using a minimal number of primitives.\nFirst, we determine the distinct Gaussian from the near ones, minimizing\nredundancy without sacrificing quality. Second, we propose a compact and\nprecise attribute representation that efficiently captures both continuity and\nirregularity among primitives. Additionally, we propose a sub-vector\nquantization technique for improved irregularity representation, maintaining\nfast training with a negligible codebook size. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that OMG reduces storage requirements by nearly 50% compared to the\nprevious state-of-the-art and enables 600+ FPS rendering while maintaining high\nrendering quality.
