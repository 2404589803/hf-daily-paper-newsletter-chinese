In terms of shape generation, we introduce a new shape foundation\nmodel -- LATTICE, which is trained with scaled high-quality datasets,\nmodel-size, and compute. Our largest model reaches 10B parameters and generates\nsharp and detailed 3D shape with precise image-3D following while keeping mesh\nsurface clean and smooth, significantly closing the gap between generated and\nhandcrafted 3D shapes. In terms of texture generation, it is upgraded with\nphyiscal-based rendering (PBR) via a novel multi-view architecture extended\nfrom Hunyuan3D 2.0 Paint model. Our extensive evaluation shows that Hunyuan3D\n2.5 significantly outperforms previous methods in both shape and end-to-end\ntexture generation.",

Using these metrics, we show that\nreranking-based methods yield strong results, and preference tuning with\nsynthetically generated and reranking-labeled data further boosts performance.\nOur findings aim to contribute to the reliable evaluation and development of\nperspective summarization methods.",
