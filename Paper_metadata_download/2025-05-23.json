In this paper, we introduce\nKRIS-Bench (Knowledge-based Reasoning in Image-editing Systems Benchmark), a\ndiagnostic benchmark designed to assess models through a cognitively informed\nlens. Drawing from educational theory, KRIS-Bench categorizes editing tasks\nacross three foundational knowledge types: Factual, Conceptual, and Procedural.\nBased on this taxonomy, we design 22 representative tasks spanning 7 reasoning\ndimensions and release 1,267 high-quality annotated editing instances. To\nsupport fine-grained evaluation, we propose a comprehensive protocol that\nincorporates a novel Knowledge Plausibility metric, enhanced by knowledge hints\nand calibrated through human studies. Empirical results on 10 state-of-the-art\nmodels reveal significant gaps in reasoning performance, highlighting the need\nfor knowledge-centric benchmarks to advance the development of intelligent\nimage editing systems.",

In this paper, we introduce\nKRIS-Bench (Knowledge-based Reasoning in Image-editing Systems Benchmark), a\ndiagnostic benchmark designed to assess models through a cognitively informed\nlens. Drawing from educational theory, KRIS-Bench categorizes editing tasks\nacross three foundational knowledge types: Factual, Conceptual, and Procedural.\nBased on this taxonomy, we design 22 representative tasks spanning 7 reasoning\ndimensions and release 1,267 high-quality annotated editing instances. To\nsupport fine-grained evaluation, we propose a comprehensive protocol that\nincorporates a novel Knowledge Plausibility metric, enhanced by knowledge hints\nand calibrated through human studies. Empirical results on 10 state-of-the-art\nmodels reveal significant gaps in reasoning performance, highlighting the need\nfor knowledge-centric benchmarks to advance the development of intelligent\nimage editing systems.",

However, this reasoning\nprocess has been confined exclusively to textual space, limiting its\neffectiveness in visually intensive tasks. To address this limitation, we\nintroduce the concept of reasoning in the pixel-space. Within this novel\nframework, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are equipped with a suite of visual\nreasoning operations, such as zoom-in and select-frame. These operations enable\nVLMs to directly inspect, interrogate, and infer from visual evidences, thereby\nenhancing reasoning fidelity for visual tasks. Cultivating such pixel-space\nreasoning capabilities in VLMs presents notable challenges, including the\nmodel's initially imbalanced competence and its reluctance to adopt the newly\nintroduced pixel-space operations. We address these challenges through a\ntwo-phase training approach. The first phase employs instruction tuning on\nsynthesized reasoning traces to familiarize the model with the novel visual\noperations. Following this, a reinforcement learning (RL) phase leverages a\ncuriosity-driven reward scheme to balance exploration between pixel-space\nreasoning and textual reasoning. With these visual operations, VLMs can\ninteract with complex visual inputs, such as information-rich images or videos\nto proactively gather necessary information. We demonstrate that this approach\nsignificantly improves VLM performance across diverse visual reasoning\nbenchmarks. Our 7B model, \\model, achieves 84\\% on V* bench, 74\\% on\nTallyQA-Complex, and 84\\% on InfographicsVQA, marking the highest accuracy\nachieved by any open-source model to date.

      "summary": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are increasingly deployed in\nfine-tuning-as-a-service (FTaaS) settings, where user-submitted datasets adapt\ngeneral-purpose models to downstream tasks. This flexibility, however,\nintroduces serious security risks, as malicious fine-tuning can implant\nbackdoors into MLLMs with minimal effort. In this paper, we observe that\nbackdoor triggers systematically disrupt cross-modal processing by causing\nabnormal attention concentration on non-semantic regions--a phenomenon we term\nattention collapse. Based on this insight, we propose Believe Your Eyes (BYE),\na data filtering framework that leverages attention entropy patterns as\nself-supervised signals to identify and filter backdoor samples. BYE operates\nvia a three-stage pipeline: (1) extracting attention maps using the fine-tuned\nmodel, (2) computing entropy scores and profiling sensitive layers via bimodal\nseparation, and (3) performing unsupervised clustering to remove suspicious\nsamples. Unlike prior defenses, BYE equires no clean supervision, auxiliary\nlabels, or model modifications. Extensive experiments across various datasets,\nmodels, and diverse trigger types validate BYE's effectiveness: it achieves\nnear-zero attack success rates while maintaining clean-task performance,\noffering a robust and generalizable solution against backdoor threats in MLLMs.",

    "summary": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are increasingly deployed in\nfine-tuning-as-a-service (FTaaS) settings, where user-submitted datasets adapt\ngeneral-purpose models to downstream tasks. This flexibility, however,\nintroduces serious security risks, as malicious fine-tuning can implant\nbackdoors into MLLMs with minimal effort. In this paper, we observe that\nbackdoor triggers systematically disrupt cross-modal processing by causing\nabnormal attention concentration on non-semantic regions--a phenomenon we term\nattention collapse. Based on this insight, we propose Believe Your Eyes (BYE),\na data filtering framework that leverages attention entropy patterns as\nself-supervised signals to identify and filter backdoor samples. BYE operates\nvia a three-stage pipeline: (1) extracting attention maps using the fine-tuned\nmodel, (2) computing entropy scores and profiling sensitive layers via bimodal\nseparation, and (3) performing unsupervised clustering to remove suspicious\nsamples. Unlike prior defenses, BYE equires no clean supervision, auxiliary\nlabels, or model modifications. Extensive experiments across various datasets,\nmodels, and diverse trigger types validate BYE's effectiveness: it achieves\nnear-zero attack success rates while maintaining clean-task performance,\noffering a robust and generalizable solution against backdoor threats in MLLMs.",

This inefficiency stems from two key challenges:\nthe quadratic complexity of self-attention with respect to token length and the\nmulti-step nature of diffusion models. To address these limitations, we present\nJenga, a novel inference pipeline that combines dynamic attention carving with\nprogressive resolution generation. Our approach leverages two key insights: (1)\nearly denoising steps do not require high-resolution latents, and (2) later\nsteps do not require dense attention.

In light of this, we propose SophiaVL-R1, as an attempt\nto add reward signals for the thinking process in this paradigm.

Growing research efforts aim to develop\nLLM-based agents to address practical demands, introducing a new challenge:\nagentic scenarios often involve lengthy instructions with complex constraints,\nsuch as extended system prompts and detailed tool specifications. While\nadherence to such instructions is crucial for agentic applications, whether\nLLMs can reliably follow them remains underexplored. In this paper, we\nintroduce AgentIF, the first benchmark for systematically evaluating LLM\ninstruction following ability in agentic scenarios. AgentIF features three key\ncharacteristics: (1) Realistic, constructed from 50 real-world agentic\napplications. (2) Long, averaging 1,723 words with a maximum of 15,630 words.\n(3) Complex, averaging 11.9 constraints per instruction, covering diverse\nconstraint types, such as tool specifications and condition constraints. To\nconstruct AgentIF, we collect 707 human-annotated instructions across 50\nagentic tasks from industrial application agents and open-source agentic\nsystems. For each instruction, we annotate the associated constraints and\ncorresponding evaluation metrics, including code-based evaluation, LLM-based\nevaluation, and hybrid code-LLM evaluation. We use AgentIF to systematically\nevaluate existing advanced LLMs. We observe that current models generally\nperform poorly, especially in handling complex constraint structures and tool\nspecifications. We further conduct error analysis and analytical experiments on\ninstruction length and meta constraints, providing some findings about the\nfailure modes of existing LLMs. We have released the code and data to\nfacilitate future research.",

In this paper, we\nintroduce AgentIF, the first benchmark for systematically evaluating LLM\ninstruction following ability in agentic scenarios. AgentIF features three key\ncharacteristics: (1) Realistic, constructed from 50 real-world agentic\napplications. (2) Long, averaging 1,723 words with a maximum of 15,630 words.\n(3) Complex, averaging 11.9 constraints per instruction, covering diverse\nconstraint types, such as tool specifications and condition constraints. To\nconstruct AgentIF, we collect 707 human-annotated instructions across 50\nagentic tasks from industrial application agents and open-source agentic\nsystems. For each instruction, we annotate the associated constraints and\ncorresponding evaluation metrics, including code-based evaluation, LLM-based\nevaluation, and hybrid code-LLM evaluation. We use AgentIF to systematically\nevaluate existing advanced LLMs. We observe that current models generally\nperform poorly, especially in handling complex constraint structures and tool\nspecifications. We further conduct error analysis and analytical experiments on\ninstruction length and meta constraints, providing some findings about the\nfailure modes of existing LLMs. We have released the code and data to\nfacilitate future research.",

We curate Robo2VLM-1, a large-scale in-the-wild dataset with 684,710\nquestions covering 463 distinct scenes and 3,396 robotic manipulation tasks\nfrom 176k real robot trajectories. Results suggest that Robo2VLM-1 can\nbenchmark and improve VLM capabilities in spatial and interaction reasoning.",
