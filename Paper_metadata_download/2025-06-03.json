In this work,\nwe undertake a pioneering exploration of RLVR through the novel perspective of\ntoken entropy patterns, comprehensively analyzing how different tokens\ninfluence reasoning performance. By examining token entropy patterns in\nChain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, we observe that only a small fraction of\ntokens exhibit high entropy, and these tokens act as critical forks that steer\nthe model toward diverse reasoning pathways. Furthermore, studying how entropy\npatterns evolve during RLVR training reveals that RLVR largely adheres to the\nbase model's entropy patterns, primarily adjusting the entropy of high-entropy\ntokens. These findings highlight the significance of high-entropy tokens (i.e.,\nforking tokens) to RLVR. We ultimately improve RLVR by restricting policy\ngradient updates to forking tokens and uncover a finding even beyond the 80/20\nrule: utilizing only 20% of the tokens while maintaining performance comparable\nto full-gradient updates on the Qwen3-8B base model and significantly\nsurpassing full-gradient updates on the Qwen3-32B (+11.04 on AIME'25 and +7.71\non AIME'24) and Qwen3-14B (+4.79 on AIME'25 and +5.21 on AIME'24) base models,\nhighlighting a strong scaling trend.

      "summary": "Open benchmarks are essential for evaluating and advancing large language\nmodels, offering reproducibility and transparency. However, their accessibility\nmakes them likely targets of test set contamination. In this work, we introduce\nDyePack, a framework that leverages backdoor attacks to identify models that\nused benchmark test sets during training, without requiring access to the loss,\nlogits, or any internal details of the model. Like how banks mix dye packs with\ntheir money to mark robbers, DyePack mixes backdoor samples with the test data\nto flag models that trained on it. We propose a principled design incorporating\nmultiple backdoors with stochastic targets, enabling exact false positive rate\n(FPR) computation when flagging every model. This provably prevents false\naccusations while providing strong evidence for every detected case of\ncontamination. We evaluate DyePack on five models across three datasets,\ncovering both multiple-choice and open-ended generation tasks. For\nmultiple-choice questions, it successfully detects all contaminated models with\nguaranteed FPRs as low as 0.000073% on MMLU-Pro and 0.000017% on Big-Bench-Hard\nusing eight backdoors. For open-ended generation tasks, it generalizes well and\nidentifies all contaminated models on Alpaca with a guaranteed false positive\nrate of just 0.127% using six backdoors.",

    "title": "DyePack: Provably Flagging Test Set Contamination in LLMs Using\n  Backdoors",
    "summary": "Open benchmarks are essential for evaluating and advancing large language\nmodels, offering reproducibility and transparency. However, their accessibility\nmakes them likely targets of test set contamination. In this work, we introduce\nDyePack, a framework that leverages backdoor attacks to identify models that\nused benchmark test sets during training, without requiring access to the loss,\nlogits, or any internal details of the model. Like how banks mix dye packs with\ntheir money to mark robbers, DyePack mixes backdoor samples with the test data\nto flag models that trained on it. We propose a principled design incorporating\nmultiple backdoors with stochastic targets, enabling exact false positive rate\n(FPR) computation when flagging every model. This provably prevents false\naccusations while providing strong evidence for every detected case of\ncontamination. We evaluate DyePack on five models across three datasets,\ncovering both multiple-choice and open-ended generation tasks. For\nmultiple-choice questions, it successfully detects all contaminated models with\nguaranteed FPRs as low as 0.000073% on MMLU-Pro and 0.000017% on Big-Bench-Hard\nusing eight backdoors. For open-ended generation tasks, it generalizes well and\nidentifies all contaminated models on Alpaca with a guaranteed false positive\nrate of just 0.127% using six backdoors.",

      "summary": "Neural audio codecs have made significant strides in efficiently mapping raw\naudio waveforms into discrete token representations, which are foundational for\ncontemporary audio generative models. However, most existing codecs are\noptimized primarily for reconstruction quality, often at the expense of the\ndownstream modelability of the encoded tokens. Motivated by the need to\novercome this bottleneck, we introduce MagiCodec, a novel\nsingle-layer, streaming Transformer-based audio codec. MagiCodec is designed\nwith a multistage training pipeline that incorporates Gaussian noise injection\nand latent regularization, explicitly targeting the enhancement of semantic\nexpressiveness in the generated codes while preserving high reconstruction\nfidelity. We analytically derive the effect of noise injection in the frequency\ndomain, demonstrating its efficacy in attenuating high-frequency components and\nfostering robust tokenization. Extensive experimental evaluations show that\nMagiCodec surpasses state-of-the-art codecs in both reconstruction quality and\ndownstream tasks. Notably, the tokens produced by MagiCodec exhibit Zipf-like\ndistributions, as observed in natural languages, thereby improving\ncompatibility with language-model-based generative architectures. The code and\npre-trained models are available at https://github.com/Ereboas/MagiCodec.",

    "summary": "Neural audio codecs have made significant strides in efficiently mapping raw\naudio waveforms into discrete token representations, which are foundational for\ncontemporary audio generative models. However, most existing codecs are\noptimized primarily for reconstruction quality, often at the expense of the\ndownstream modelability of the encoded tokens. Motivated by the need to\novercome this bottleneck, we introduce MagiCodec, a novel\nsingle-layer, streaming Transformer-based audio codec. MagiCodec is designed\nwith a multistage training pipeline that incorporates Gaussian noise injection\nand latent regularization, explicitly targeting the enhancement of semantic\nexpressiveness in the generated codes while preserving high reconstruction\nfidelity. We analytically derive the effect of noise injection in the frequency\ndomain, demonstrating its efficacy in attenuating high-frequency components and\nfostering robust tokenization. Extensive experimental evaluations show that\nMagiCodec surpasses state-of-the-art codecs in both reconstruction quality and\ndownstream tasks. Notably, the tokens produced by MagiCodec exhibit Zipf-like\ndistributions, as observed in natural languages, thereby improving\ncompatibility with language-model-based generative architectures.

In addition, we investigated the effect of increasing the\ntest-time compute, through reasoning and self-reflection mechanisms, on those\nmetrics. While effective in other tasks, our results show that these mechanisms\noffer only limited gains in our domain. Furthermore, we reveal that newer model\nversions are becoming less consistent and more biased toward specific\nviewpoints, highlighting a blind spot and a concerning trend.

We introduce zip2zip, a\nframework that enables LLMs to dynamically adjust token vocabulary at inference\ntime, allowing for fewer generated tokens and thus faster inference. zip2zip\nconsists of three key components: (1) a tokenizer based on Lempel-Ziv-Welch\n(LZW) compression that incrementally compresses tokens into reusable\n\"hypertokens\" on the fly; (2) an embedding layer that computes embeddings for\nnewly formed hypertokens at runtime; and (3) a causal language modeling variant\nthat trains the model to operate on hypertokenized, compressed sequences. We\nshow that an existing LLM can be zip2zip-fied in 10 GPU-hours via\nparameter-efficient finetuning. The resulting zip2zip LLMs effectively learn to\nuse hypertokens at inference time, reducing input and output sequence length by\n20-60\\%, with significant improvements in inference latency.",
