This makes multimodal Deep Research highly\nchallenging, as such agents require much stronger reasoning abilities in\nperception, logic, knowledge, and the use of more sophisticated tools compared\nto text-based agents. To address this limitation, we introduce WebWatcher, a\nmulti-modal Agent for Deep Research equipped with enhanced visual-language\nreasoning capabilities. It leverages high-quality synthetic multimodal\ntrajectories for efficient cold start training, utilizes various tools for deep\nreasoning, and further enhances generalization through reinforcement learning.\nTo better evaluate the capabilities of multimodal agents, we propose\nBrowseComp-VL, a benchmark with BrowseComp-style that requires complex\ninformation retrieval involving both visual and textual information.\nExperimental results show that WebWatcher significantly outperforms proprietary\nbaseline, RAG workflow and open-source agents in four challenging VQA\nbenchmarks, which paves the way for solving complex multimodal\ninformation-seeking tasks.",

Finally,\nwe employ a novel neighbor-constrained 4D gaussian splatting optimization on\nthese multi-view videos, resulting in continuous and stable 4D character\nrepresentations. Moreover, to improve character-centric performance, we\nconstruct a large-scale dataset Character4D, containing 13,115 unique\ncharacters with diverse appearances and motions, rendered from multiple\nviewpoints.

Finally,\nwe employ a novel neighbor-constrained 4D gaussian splatting optimization on\nthese multi-view videos, resulting in continuous and stable 4D character\nrepresentations. Moreover, to improve character-centric performance, we\nconstruct a large-scale dataset Character4D, containing 13,115 unique\ncharacters with diverse appearances and motions, rendered from multiple\nviewpoints. Extensive experiments on our newly constructed benchmark,\nCharacterBench, demonstrate that our approach outperforms current\nstate-of-the-art methods. Code, models, and datasets will be publicly available\nat https://github.com/Jeoyal/CharacterShot.",

      "summary": "Text-to-image (T2I) generation has been actively studied using Diffusion\nModels and Autoregressive Models. Recently, Masked Generative Transformers have\ngained attention as an alternative to Autoregressive Models to overcome the\ninherent limitations of causal attention and autoregressive decoding through\nbidirectional attention and parallel decoding, enabling efficient and\nhigh-quality image generation. However, compositional T2I generation remains\nchallenging, as even state-of-the-art Diffusion Models often fail to accurately\nbind attributes and achieve proper text-image alignment. While Diffusion Models\nhave been extensively studied for this issue, Masked Generative Transformers\nexhibit similar limitations but have not been explored in this context. To\naddress this, we propose Unmasking with Contrastive Attention Guidance\n(UNCAGE), a novel training-free method that improves compositional fidelity by\nleveraging attention maps to prioritize the unmasking of tokens that clearly\nrepresent individual objects. UNCAGE consistently improves performance in both\nquantitative and qualitative evaluations across multiple benchmarks and\nmetrics, with negligible inference overhead.

    "title": "UNCAGE: Contrastive Attention Guidance for Masked Generative\n  Transformers in Text-to-Image Generation",
    "summary": "Text-to-image (T2I) generation has been actively studied using Diffusion\nModels and Autoregressive Models. Recently, Masked Generative Transformers have\ngained attention as an alternative to Autoregressive Models to overcome the\ninherent limitations of causal attention and autoregressive decoding through\nbidirectional attention and parallel decoding, enabling efficient and\nhigh-quality image generation. However, compositional T2I generation remains\nchallenging, as even state-of-the-art Diffusion Models often fail to accurately\nbind attributes and achieve proper text-image alignment. While Diffusion Models\nhave been extensively studied for this issue, Masked Generative Transformers\nexhibit similar limitations but have not been explored in this context. To\naddress this, we propose Unmasking with Contrastive Attention Guidance\n(UNCAGE), a novel training-free method that improves compositional fidelity by\nleveraging attention maps to prioritize the unmasking of tokens that clearly\nrepresent individual objects. UNCAGE consistently improves performance in both\nquantitative and qualitative evaluations across multiple benchmarks and\nmetrics, with negligible inference overhead. Our code is available at\nhttps://github.com/furiosa-ai/uncage.",

While\nnumerous benchmarks have been proposed to evaluate their code generation\nabilities, these benchmarks face several critical limitations. First, they\noften rely on manual annotations, which are time-consuming and difficult to\nscale across different programming languages and problem complexities. Second,\nmost existing benchmarks focus primarily on Python, while the few multilingual\nbenchmarks suffer from limited difficulty and uneven language distribution. To\naddress these challenges, we propose AutoCodeGen, an automated method for\ngenerating high-difficulty multilingual code generation datasets without manual\nannotations. AutoCodeGen ensures the correctness and completeness of test cases\nby generating test inputs with LLMs and obtaining test outputs through a\nmultilingual sandbox, while achieving high data quality through reverse-order\nproblem generation and multiple filtering steps. Using this novel method, we\nintroduce AutoCodeBench, a large-scale code generation benchmark comprising\n3,920 problems evenly distributed across 20 programming languages. It is\nspecifically designed to evaluate LLMs on challenging, diverse, and practical\nmultilingual tasks. We evaluate over 30 leading open-source and proprietary\nLLMs on AutoCodeBench and its simplified version AutoCodeBench-Lite. The\nresults show that even the most advanced LLMs struggle with the complexity,\ndiversity, and multilingual nature of these tasks. Besides, we introduce\nAutoCodeBench-Complete, specifically designed for base models to assess their\nfew-shot code generation capabilities. We hope the AutoCodeBench series will\nserve as a valuable resource and inspire the community to focus on more\nchallenging and practical multilingual code generation scenarios.",

      "summary": "Paralinguistic vocalizations-including non-verbal sounds like laughter and\nbreathing, as well as lexicalized interjections such as \"uhm\" and \"oh\"-are\nintegral to natural spoken communication. Despite their importance in conveying\naffect, intent, and interactional cues, such cues remain largely overlooked in\nconventional automatic speech recognition (ASR) and text-to-speech (TTS)\nsystems. We present NVSpeech, an integrated and scalable pipeline that bridges\nthe recognition and synthesis of paralinguistic vocalizations, encompassing\ndataset construction, ASR modeling, and controllable TTS. (1) We introduce a\nmanually annotated dataset of 48,430 human-spoken utterances with 18 word-level\nparalinguistic categories. (2) We develop the paralinguistic-aware ASR model,\nwhich treats paralinguistic cues as inline decodable tokens (e.g., \"You're so\nfunny [Laughter]\"), enabling joint lexical and non-verbal transcription. This\nmodel is then used to automatically annotate a large corpus, the first\nlarge-scale Chinese dataset of 174,179 utterances (573 hours) with word-level\nalignment and paralingustic cues. (3) We finetune zero-shot TTS models on both\nhuman- and auto-labeled data to enable explicit control over paralinguistic\nvocalizations, allowing context-aware insertion at arbitrary token positions\nfor human-like speech synthesis. By unifying the recognition and generation of\nparalinguistic vocalizations, NVSpeech offers the first open, large-scale,\nword-level annotated pipeline for expressive speech modeling in Mandarin,\nintegrating recognition and synthesis in a scalable and controllable manner.\nDataset and audio demos are available at https://nvspeech170k.github.io/.",
