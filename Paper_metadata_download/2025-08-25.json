In contrast, our method enables\nlow-cost continual adaptation via memory-based online reinforcement learning.\nWe formalise this as a Memory-augmented Markov Decision Process (M-MDP),\nequipped with a neural case-selection policy to guide action decisions. Past\nexperiences are stored in an episodic memory, either differentiable or\nnon-parametric. The policy is continually updated based on environmental\nfeedback through a memory rewriting mechanism, whereas policy improvement is\nachieved through efficient memory reading (retrieval). We instantiate our agent\nmodel in the deep research setting, namely AgentFly, which attains top-1 on\nGAIA validation (87.88% Pass@3) and 79.40% on the test set. It reaches\n66.6% F1 and 80.4% PM on the DeepResearcher dataset, outperforming the\nstate-of-the-art training-based method, while case-based memory adds 4.7% to\n9.6% absolute points on out-of-distribution tasks. Our approach offers a\nscalable and efficient pathway for developing generalist LLM agents capable of\ncontinuous, real-time learning without gradient updates, advancing machine\nlearning towards open-ended skill acquisition and deep research scenarios.

Weakly supervised affordance\ngrounding (WSAG) seeks to imitate human learning from third-person\ndemonstrations, where humans intuitively grasp functional parts without needing\npixel-level annotations.

Retrieval and tool-augmented methods help,\nbut their impact is limited by weak use of external knowledge and poor\nfeedback-reasoning traceability. To address these challenges, We introduce\nDeep-DxSearch, an agentic RAG system trained end-to-end with reinforcement\nlearning (RL) that enables steer tracebale retrieval-augmented reasoning for\nmedical diagnosis. In Deep-DxSearch, we first construct a large-scale medical\nretrieval corpus comprising patient records and reliable medical knowledge\nsources to support retrieval-aware reasoning across diagnostic scenarios. More\ncrutially, we frame the LLM as the core agent and the retrieval corpus as its\nenvironment, using tailored rewards on format, retrieval, reasoning structure,\nand diagnostic accuracy, thereby evolving the agentic RAG policy from\nlarge-scale data through RL.\n  Experiments demonstrate that our end-to-end agentic RL training framework\nconsistently outperforms prompt-engineering and training-free RAG approaches\nacross multiple data centers. After training, Deep-DxSearch achieves\nsubstantial gains in diagnostic accuracy, surpassing strong diagnostic\nbaselines such as GPT-4o, DeepSeek-R1, and other medical-specific frameworks\nfor both common and rare disease diagnosis under in-distribution and\nout-of-distribution settings. Moreover, ablation studies on reward design and\nretrieval corpus components confirm their critical roles, underscoring the\nuniqueness and effectiveness of our approach compared with traditional\nimplementations. Finally, case studies and interpretability analyses highlight\nimprovements in Deep-DxSearch's diagnostic policy, providing deeper insight\ninto its performance gains and supporting clinicians in delivering more\nreliable and precise preliminary diagnoses.

To address these challenges, We introduce\nDeep-DxSearch, an agentic RAG system trained end-to-end with reinforcement\nlearning (RL) that enables steer tracebale retrieval-augmented reasoning for\nmedical diagnosis. In Deep-DxSearch, we first construct a large-scale medical\nretrieval corpus comprising patient records and reliable medical knowledge\nsources to support retrieval-aware reasoning across diagnostic scenarios. More\ncrutially, we frame the LLM as the core agent and the retrieval corpus as its\nenvironment, using tailored rewards on format, retrieval, reasoning structure,\nand diagnostic accuracy, thereby evolving the agentic RAG policy from\nlarge-scale data through RL.\n  Experiments demonstrate that our end-to-end agentic RL training framework\nconsistently outperforms prompt-engineering and training-free RAG approaches\nacross multiple data centers. After training, Deep-DxSearch achieves\nsubstantial gains in diagnostic accuracy, surpassing strong diagnostic\nbaselines such as GPT-4o, DeepSeek-R1, and other medical-specific frameworks\nfor both common and rare disease diagnosis under in-distribution and\nout-of-distribution settings. Moreover, ablation studies on reward design and\nretrieval corpus components confirm their critical roles, underscoring the\nuniqueness and effectiveness of our approach compared with traditional\nimplementations. Finally, case studies and interpretability analyses highlight\nimprovements in Deep-DxSearch's diagnostic policy, providing deeper insight\ninto its performance gains and supporting clinicians in delivering more\nreliable and precise preliminary diagnoses.

While\nprevious evaluations have explored whether LLMs can infer intentions or detect\ndeception, they often overlook the individualized reasoning styles that\ninfluence how people interpret and act in social contexts. Social deduction\ngames (SDGs) provide a natural testbed for evaluating individualized reasoning\nstyles, where different players may adopt diverse but contextually valid\nreasoning strategies under identical conditions. To address this, we introduce\nInMind, a cognitively grounded evaluation framework designed to assess whether\nLLMs can capture and apply personalized reasoning styles in SDGs. InMind\nenhances structured gameplay data with round-level strategy traces and\npost-game reflections, collected under both Observer and Participant modes. It\nsupports four cognitively motivated tasks that jointly evaluate both static\nalignment and dynamic adaptation. As a case study, we apply InMind to the game\nAvalon, evaluating 11 state-of-the-art LLMs. General-purpose LLMs, even GPT-4o\nfrequently rely on lexical cues, struggling to anchor reflections in temporal\ngameplay or adapt to evolving strategies. In contrast, reasoning-enhanced LLMs\nlike DeepSeek-R1 exhibit early signs of style-sensitive reasoning. These\nfindings reveal key limitations in current LLMs' capacity for individualized,\nadaptive reasoning, and position InMind as a step toward cognitively aligned\nhuman-AI interaction.",

    "summary": "LLMs have shown strong performance on human-centric reasoning tasks. While\nprevious evaluations have explored whether LLMs can infer intentions or detect\ndeception, they often overlook the individualized reasoning styles that\ninfluence how people interpret and act in social contexts. Social deduction\ngames (SDGs) provide a natural testbed for evaluating individualized reasoning\nstyles, where different players may adopt diverse but contextually valid\nreasoning strategies under identical conditions. To address this, we introduce\nInMind, a cognitively grounded evaluation framework designed to assess whether\nLLMs can capture and apply personalized reasoning styles in SDGs. InMind\nenhances structured gameplay data with round-level strategy traces and\npost-game reflections, collected under both Observer and Participant modes. It\nsupports four cognitively motivated tasks that jointly evaluate both static\nalignment and dynamic adaptation. As a case study, we apply InMind to the game\nAvalon, evaluating 11 state-of-the-art LLMs. General-purpose LLMs, even GPT-4o\nfrequently rely on lexical cues, struggling to anchor reflections in temporal\ngameplay or adapt to evolving strategies. In contrast, reasoning-enhanced LLMs\nlike DeepSeek-R1 exhibit early signs of style-sensitive reasoning. These\nfindings reveal key limitations in current LLMs' capacity for individualized,\nadaptive reasoning, and position InMind as a step toward cognitively aligned\nhuman-AI interaction.",
