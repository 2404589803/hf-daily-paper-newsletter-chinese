In this work, we present a systematic training recipe for SLMs that\nconsists of four steps: (1) large-scale mid-training on diverse distilled\nlong-CoT data, (2) supervised fine-tuning on high-quality long-CoT data, (3)\nRollout DPO leveraging a carefully curated preference dataset, and (4)\nReinforcement Learning (RL) with Verifiable Reward. We apply our method on\nPhi-4-Mini, a compact 3.8B-parameter model. The resulting Phi-4-Mini-Reasoning\nmodel exceeds, on math reasoning tasks, much larger reasoning models, e.g.,\noutperforming DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B by 3.2 points and\nDeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B by 7.7 points on Math-500. Our results validate\nthat a carefully designed training recipe, with large-scale high-quality CoT\ndata, is effective to unlock strong reasoning capabilities even in\nresource-constrained small models.",

      "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) for Generative AI have achieved remarkable\nprogress, evolving into sophisticated and versatile tools widely adopted across\nvarious domains and applications. However, the substantial memory overhead\ncaused by their vast number of parameters, combined with the high computational\ndemands of the attention mechanism, poses significant challenges in achieving\nlow latency and high throughput for LLM inference services. Recent\nadvancements, driven by groundbreaking research, have significantly accelerated\nprogress in this field. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of these\nmethods, covering fundamental instance-level approaches, in-depth cluster-level\nstrategies, emerging scenario directions, and other miscellaneous but important\nareas. At the instance level, we review model placement, request scheduling,\ndecoding length prediction, storage management, and the disaggregation\nparadigm. At the cluster level, we explore GPU cluster deployment,\nmulti-instance load balancing, and cloud service solutions. For emerging\nscenarios, we organize the discussion around specific tasks, modules, and\nauxiliary methods. To ensure a holistic overview, we also highlight several\nniche yet critical areas. Finally, we outline potential research directions to\nfurther advance the field of LLM inference serving.",

    "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) for Generative AI have achieved remarkable\nprogress, evolving into sophisticated and versatile tools widely adopted across\nvarious domains and applications. However, the substantial memory overhead\ncaused by their vast number of parameters, combined with the high computational\ndemands of the attention mechanism, poses significant challenges in achieving\nlow latency and high throughput for LLM inference services. Recent\nadvancements, driven by groundbreaking research, have significantly accelerated\nprogress in this field. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of these\nmethods, covering fundamental instance-level approaches, in-depth cluster-level\nstrategies, emerging scenario directions, and other miscellaneous but important\nareas. At the instance level, we review model placement, request scheduling,\ndecoding length prediction, storage management, and the disaggregation\nparadigm. At the cluster level, we explore GPU cluster deployment,\nmulti-instance load balancing, and cloud service solutions. For emerging\nscenarios, we organize the discussion around specific tasks, modules, and\nauxiliary methods. To ensure a holistic overview, we also highlight several\nniche yet critical areas. Finally, we outline potential research directions to\nfurther advance the field of LLM inference serving.",

      "summary": "In recent years, video generation has seen significant advancements. However,\nchallenges still persist in generating complex motions and interactions. To\naddress these challenges, we introduce ReVision, a plug-and-play framework that\nexplicitly integrates parameterized 3D physical knowledge into a pretrained\nconditional video generation model, significantly enhancing its ability to\ngenerate high-quality videos with complex motion and interactions.\nSpecifically, ReVision consists of three stages. First, a video diffusion model\nis used to generate a coarse video. Next, we extract a set of 2D and 3D\nfeatures from the coarse video to construct a 3D object-centric representation,\nwhich is then refined by our proposed parameterized physical prior model to\nproduce an accurate 3D motion sequence. Finally, this refined motion sequence\nis fed back into the same video diffusion model as additional conditioning,\nenabling the generation of motion-consistent videos, even in scenarios\ninvolving complex actions and interactions. We validate the effectiveness of\nour approach on Stable Video Diffusion, where ReVision significantly improves\nmotion fidelity and coherence. Remarkably, with only 1.5B parameters, it even\noutperforms a state-of-the-art video generation model with over 13B parameters\non complex video generation by a substantial margin. Our results suggest that,\nby incorporating 3D physical knowledge, even a relatively small video diffusion\nmodel can generate complex motions and interactions with greater realism and\ncontrollability, offering a promising solution for physically plausible video\ngeneration.",
