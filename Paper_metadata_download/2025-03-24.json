While progress has been made\nin addressing traditional scientific problems, MSPs still face two primary\nissues: the challenge of multi-modal comprehensive reasoning in scientific\nproblem-solving and the lack of reflective and rethinking capabilities. To\naddress these issues, we introduce a Multi-Agent framework based on the Big\nSeven Personality and Socratic guidance (MAPS). This framework employs seven\ndistinct agents that leverage feedback mechanisms and the Socratic method to\nguide the resolution of MSPs. To tackle the first issue, we propose a\nprogressive four-agent solving strategy, where each agent focuses on a specific\nstage of the problem-solving process. For the second issue, we introduce a\nCritic agent, inspired by Socratic questioning, which prompts critical thinking\nand stimulates autonomous learning. We conduct extensive experiments on the\nEMMA, Olympiad, and MathVista datasets, achieving promising results that\noutperform the current SOTA model by 15.84% across all tasks. Meanwhile, the\nadditional analytical experiments also verify the model's progress as well as\ngeneralization ability.",

This\nmetric, which includes intra-annotator confidence and inter-annotator\nstability, distinguishes between majority and minority samples. We introduce an\nAdaptive-DPO loss function which improves the DPO loss in two ways: enhancing\nthe model's learning of majority labels while mitigating the negative impact of\nminority samples. Our experiments demonstrate that this method effectively\nhandles both synthetic minority data and real-world preference data, paving the\nway for more effective training methodologies in image generation tasks.",

Previous research examining `implicit\nbias' in large language models (LLMs) has often approached the phenomenon\ndifferently than how it is studied in humans by focusing primarily on model\noutputs rather than on model processing. To examine model processing, we\npresent a method called the Reasoning Model Implicit Association Test (RM-IAT)\nfor studying implicit bias-like patterns in reasoning models: LLMs that employ\nstep-by-step reasoning to solve complex tasks. Using this method, we find that\nreasoning models require more tokens when processing association-incompatible\ninformation compared to association-compatible information. These findings\nsuggest AI systems harbor patterns in processing information that are analogous\nto human implicit bias. We consider the implications of these implicit\nbias-like patterns for their deployment in real-world applications.",

This raises the question of whether all generated tokens are equally\nvaluable or if some of them can be discarded to reduce computational costs\nwithout compromising quality. In this paper, we introduce a new method for\ndetermining feature utility based on the idea that less valuable features can\nbe reconstructed from more valuable ones. We implement this concept by\nintegrating an autoencoder with a Gumbel-Softmax selection mechanism, that\nallows identifying and retaining only the most informative visual tokens. To\nvalidate our approach, we compared the performance of the LLaVA-NeXT model,\nusing features selected by our method with randomly selected features. We found\nthat on OCR-based tasks, more than 50% of the visual context can be removed\nwith minimal performance loss, whereas randomly discarding the same proportion\nof features significantly affects the model capabilities. Furthermore, in\ngeneral-domain tasks, even randomly retaining only 30% of tokens achieves\nperformance comparable to using the full set of visual tokens. Our results\nhighlight a promising direction towards adaptive and efficient multimodal\npruning that facilitates scalable and low-overhead inference without\ncompromising performance.",
