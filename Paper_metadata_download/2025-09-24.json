To address\nthis challenge, we introduce Reinforcement Learning on Pre-Training data\n(RLPT), a new training-time scaling paradigm for optimizing LLMs. In contrast\nto prior approaches that scale training primarily through supervised learning,\nRLPT enables the policy to autonomously explore meaningful trajectories to\nlearn from pre-training data and improve its capability through reinforcement\nlearning (RL). While existing RL strategies such as reinforcement learning from\nhuman feedback (RLHF) and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR)\nrely on human annotation for reward construction, RLPT eliminates this\ndependency by deriving reward signals directly from pre-training data.\nSpecifically, it adopts a next-segment reasoning objective, rewarding the\npolicy for accurately predicting subsequent text segments conditioned on the\npreceding context. This formulation allows RL to be scaled on pre-training\ndata, encouraging the exploration of richer trajectories across broader\ncontexts and thereby fostering more generalizable reasoning skills. Extensive\nexperiments on both general-domain and mathematical reasoning benchmarks across\nmultiple models validate the effectiveness of RLPT. For example, when applied\nto Qwen3-4B-Base, RLPT yields absolute improvements of 3.0, 5.1, 8.1,\n6.0, 6.6, and 5.3 on MMLU, MMLU-Pro, GPQA-Diamond, KOR-Bench, AIME24, and\nAIME25, respectively.

On the contrary, we propose the State-free\nPolicy, removing the proprioceptive state input and predicting actions only\nconditioned on visual observations. The State-free Policy is built in the\nrelative end-effector action space, and should ensure the full task-relevant\nvisual observations, here provided by dual wide-angle wrist cameras. Empirical\nresults demonstrate that the State-free policy achieves significantly stronger\nspatial generalization than the state-based policy: in real-world tasks such as\npick-and-place, challenging shirt-folding, and complex whole-body manipulation,\nspanning multiple robot embodiments, the average success rate improves from 0\\%\nto 85\\% in height generalization and from 6\\% to 64\\% in horizontal\ngeneralization.

Currently, the automatic analysis of such data is\npredominantly managed through machine learning models specifically trained for\nmulti-spectral input, which are costly to train and support. Furthermore,\nalthough providing a lot of utility for Remote Sensing, such additional inputs\ncannot be used with powerful generalist large multimodal models, which are\ncapable of solving many visual problems, but are not able to understand\nspecialized multi-spectral signals.\n  To address this, we propose a training-free approach which introduces new\nmulti-spectral data in a Zero-Shot-only mode, as inputs to generalist\nmultimodal models, trained on RGB-only inputs. Our approach leverages the\nmultimodal models' understanding of the visual space, and proposes to adapt to\ninputs to that space, and to inject domain-specific information as instructions\ninto the model. We exemplify this idea with the Gemini2.5 model and observe\nstrong Zero-Shot performance gains of the approach on popular Remote Sensing\nbenchmarks for land cover and land use classification and demonstrate the easy\nadaptability of Gemini2.5 to new inputs.

      "summary": "Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a powerful alternative\nto NeRF-based approaches, enabling real-time, high-quality novel view synthesis\nthrough explicit, optimizable 3D Gaussians. However, 3DGS suffers from\nsignificant memory overhead due to its reliance on per-Gaussian parameters to\nmodel view-dependent effects and anisotropic shapes. While recent works propose\ncompressing 3DGS with neural fields, these methods struggle to capture\nhigh-frequency spatial variations in Gaussian properties, leading to degraded\nreconstruction of fine details. We present Hybrid Radiance Fields (HyRF), a\nnovel scene representation that combines the strengths of explicit Gaussians\nand neural fields. HyRF decomposes the scene into (1) a compact set of explicit\nGaussians storing only critical high-frequency parameters and (2) grid-based\nneural fields that predict remaining properties. To enhance representational\ncapacity, we introduce a decoupled neural field architecture, separately\nmodeling geometry (scale, opacity, rotation) and view-dependent color.\nAdditionally, we propose a hybrid rendering scheme that composites Gaussian\nsplatting with a neural field-predicted background, addressing limitations in\ndistant scene representation. Experiments demonstrate that HyRF achieves\nstate-of-the-art rendering quality while reducing model size by over 20 times\ncompared to 3DGS and maintaining real-time performance.
