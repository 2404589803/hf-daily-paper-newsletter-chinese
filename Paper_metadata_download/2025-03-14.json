Previous studies have typically\nfocused on either enhancing the visual quality of synthesized images at the\nexpense of sampling efficiency or dramatically accelerating sampling without\nimproving the base model's generative capacity. Moreover, nearly all inference\nmethods have not been able to ensure stable performance simultaneously on both\ndiffusion models (DMs) and visual autoregressive models (ARMs). In this paper,\nwe introduce a novel plug-and-play inference paradigm, CoRe^2, which comprises\nthree subprocesses: Collect, Reflect, and Refine. CoRe^2 first collects\nclassifier-free guidance (CFG) trajectories, and then use collected data to\ntrain a weak model that reflects the easy-to-learn contents while reducing\nnumber of function evaluations during inference by half. Subsequently, CoRe^2\nemploys weak-to-strong guidance to refine the conditional output, thereby\nimproving the model's capacity to generate high-frequency and realistic\ncontent, which is difficult for the base model to capture. To the best of our\nknowledge, CoRe^2 is the first to demonstrate both efficiency and effectiveness\nacross a wide range of DMs, including SDXL, SD3.5, and FLUX, as well as ARMs\nlike LlamaGen.

    "summary": "Vision-Language Models have made significant progress on many\nperception-focused tasks, however, their progress on reasoning-focused tasks\nseem to be limited due to the lack of high-quality and diverse training data.\nIn this work, we aim to address the scarcity issue of reasoning-focused\nmultimodal datasets. We propose VisualWebInstruct - a novel approach that\nleverages search engine to create a diverse, and high-quality dataset spanning\nmultiple disciplines like math, physics, finance, chemistry, etc. Starting with\nmeticulously selected 30,000 seed images, we employ Google Image search to\nidentify websites containing similar images. We collect and process the HTMLs\nfrom over 700K unique URL sources. Through a pipeline of content extraction,\nfiltering and synthesis, we build a dataset of approximately 900K\nquestion-answer pairs, with 40% being visual QA pairs and the rest as text QA\npairs. Models fine-tuned on VisualWebInstruct demonstrate significant\nperformance gains: (1) training from Llava-OV-mid shows 10-20% absolute point\ngains across benchmarks, (2) training from MAmmoTH-VL shows 5% absoluate gain.\nOur best model MAmmoTH-VL2 shows state-of-the-art performance within the 10B\nparameter class on MMMU-Pro-std (40.7%), MathVerse (42.6%), and DynaMath\n(55.7%). These remarkable results highlight the effectiveness of our dataset in\nenhancing VLMs' reasoning capabilities for complex multimodal tasks.",

      "title": "Autoregressive Image Generation with Randomized Parallel Decoding",
      "summary": "We introduce ARPG, a novel visual autoregressive model that enables\nrandomized parallel generation, addressing the inherent limitations of\nconventional raster-order approaches, which hinder inference efficiency and\nzero-shot generalization due to their sequential, predefined token generation\norder. Our key insight is that effective random-order modeling necessitates\nexplicit guidance for determining the position of the next predicted token. To\nthis end, we propose a novel guided decoding framework that decouples\npositional guidance from content representation, encoding them separately as\nqueries and key-value pairs. By directly incorporating this guidance into the\ncausal attention mechanism, our approach enables fully random-order training\nand generation, eliminating the need for bidirectional attention. Consequently,\nARPG readily generalizes to zero-shot tasks such as image inpainting,\noutpainting, and resolution expansion.

    "summary": "We introduce ARPG, a novel visual autoregressive model that enables\nrandomized parallel generation, addressing the inherent limitations of\nconventional raster-order approaches, which hinder inference efficiency and\nzero-shot generalization due to their sequential, predefined token generation\norder. Our key insight is that effective random-order modeling necessitates\nexplicit guidance for determining the position of the next predicted token. To\nthis end, we propose a novel guided decoding framework that decouples\npositional guidance from content representation, encoding them separately as\nqueries and key-value pairs. By directly incorporating this guidance into the\ncausal attention mechanism, our approach enables fully random-order training\nand generation, eliminating the need for bidirectional attention.

(2) SANA-Sprint is a unified step-adaptive model that\nachieves high-quality generation in 1-4 steps, eliminating step-specific\ntraining and improving efficiency. (3) We integrate ControlNet with SANA-Sprint\nfor real-time interactive image generation, enabling instant visual feedback\nfor user interaction. SANA-Sprint establishes a new Pareto frontier in\nspeed-quality tradeoffs, achieving state-of-the-art performance with 7.59 FID\nand 0.74 GenEval in only 1 step - outperforming FLUX-schnell (7.94 FID / 0.71\nGenEval) while being 10x faster (0.1s vs 1.1s on H100). It also achieves 0.1s\n(T2I) and 0.25s (ControlNet) latency for 1024 x 1024 images on H100, and 0.31s\n(T2I) on an RTX 4090, showcasing its exceptional efficiency and potential for\nAI-powered consumer applications (AIPC). Code and pre-trained models will be\nopen-sourced.",

This leads to computationally less demanding inference as fewer\nintegration steps and less complex numerical solvers can be employed when\nnumerically solving an ordinary differential equation at test time.

      "summary": "Toxicity in bug report discussions poses significant challenges to the\ncollaborative dynamics of open-source software development. Bug reports are\ncrucial for identifying and resolving defects, yet their inherently\nproblem-focused nature and emotionally charged context make them susceptible to\ntoxic interactions. This study explores toxicity in GitHub bug reports through\na qualitative analysis of 203 bug threads, including 81 toxic ones. Our\nfindings reveal that toxicity frequently arises from misaligned perceptions of\nbug severity and priority, unresolved frustrations with tools, and lapses in\nprofessional communication. These toxic interactions not only derail productive\ndiscussions but also reduce the likelihood of actionable outcomes, such as\nlinking issues with pull requests. Our preliminary findings offer actionable\nrecommendations to improve bug resolution by mitigating toxicity.",
