Leveraging recent advances in brain-computer interfaces\n(BCIs) and generative models, we propose LoongX, a hands-free image editing\napproach driven by multimodal neurophysiological signals. LoongX utilizes\nstate-of-the-art diffusion models trained on a comprehensive dataset of 23,928\nimage editing pairs, each paired with synchronized electroencephalography\n(EEG), functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), photoplethysmography\n(PPG), and head motion signals that capture user intent. To effectively address\nthe heterogeneity of these signals, LoongX integrates two key modules. The\ncross-scale state space (CS3) module encodes informative modality-specific\nfeatures. The dynamic gated fusion (DGF) module further aggregates these\nfeatures into a unified latent space, which is then aligned with edit semantics\nvia fine-tuning on a diffusion transformer (DiT). Additionally, we pre-train\nthe encoders using contrastive learning to align cognitive states with semantic\nintentions from embedded natural language.

To enable large-scale training, we construct Partverse - a novel 3D\npart dataset derived from Objaverse through automated mesh segmentation and\nhuman-verified annotations.

    "summary": "Recent advances in 3D generation have transitioned from multi-view 2D\nrendering approaches to 3D-native latent diffusion frameworks that exploit\ngeometric priors in ground truth data. Despite progress, three key limitations\npersist: (1) Single-latent representations fail to capture complex multi-part\ngeometries, causing detail degradation; (2) Holistic latent coding neglects\npart independence and interrelationships critical for compositional design; (3)\nGlobal conditioning mechanisms lack fine-grained controllability. Inspired by\nhuman 3D design workflows, we propose CoPart - a part-aware diffusion framework\nthat decomposes 3D objects into contextual part latents for coherent multi-part\ngeneration. This paradigm offers three advantages: i) Reduces encoding\ncomplexity through part decomposition; ii) Enables explicit part relationship\nmodeling; iii) Supports part-level conditioning. We further develop a mutual\nguidance strategy to fine-tune pre-trained diffusion models for joint part\nlatent denoising, ensuring both geometric coherence and foundation model\npriors. To enable large-scale training, we construct Partverse - a novel 3D\npart dataset derived from Objaverse through automated mesh segmentation and\nhuman-verified annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate CoPart's superior\ncapabilities in part-level editing, articulated object generation, and scene\ncomposition with unprecedented controllability.",

However,\nevaluating whether these models truly capture deeper structure remains a\nchallenge. We develop a technique for evaluating foundation models that\nexamines how they adapt to synthetic datasets generated from some postulated\nworld model. Our technique measures whether the foundation model's inductive\nbias aligns with the world model, and so we refer to it as an inductive bias\nprobe. Across multiple domains, we find that foundation models can excel at\ntheir training tasks yet fail to develop inductive biases towards the\nunderlying world model when adapted to new tasks. We particularly find that\nfoundation models trained on orbital trajectories consistently fail to apply\nNewtonian mechanics when adapted to new physics tasks. Further analysis reveals\nthat these models behave as if they develop task-specific heuristics that fail\nto generalize.",

    "title": "What Has a Foundation Model Found? Using Inductive Bias to Probe for\n  World Models",
    "summary": "Foundation models are premised on the idea that sequence prediction can\nuncover deeper domain understanding, much like how Kepler's predictions of\nplanetary motion later led to the discovery of Newtonian mechanics. However,\nevaluating whether these models truly capture deeper structure remains a\nchallenge. We develop a technique for evaluating foundation models that\nexamines how they adapt to synthetic datasets generated from some postulated\nworld model. Our technique measures whether the foundation model's inductive\nbias aligns with the world model, and so we refer to it as an inductive bias\nprobe. Across multiple domains, we find that foundation models can excel at\ntheir training tasks yet fail to develop inductive biases towards the\nunderlying world model when adapted to new tasks. We particularly find that\nfoundation models trained on orbital trajectories consistently fail to apply\nNewtonian mechanics when adapted to new physics tasks. Further analysis reveals\nthat these models behave as if they develop task-specific heuristics that fail\nto generalize.",
