To address this challenge, we introduce\nthe first benchmark and metric suite for poster generation, which pairs recent\nconference papers with author-designed posters and evaluates outputs on\n(i)Visual Quality-semantic alignment with human posters, (ii)Textual\nCoherence-language fluency, (iii)Holistic Assessment-six fine-grained aesthetic\nand informational criteria scored by a VLM-as-judge, and notably\n(iv)PaperQuiz-the poster's ability to convey core paper content as measured by\nVLMs answering generated quizzes. Building on this benchmark, we propose\nPosterAgent, a top-down, visual-in-the-loop multi-agent pipeline: the (a)Parser\ndistills the paper into a structured asset library; the (b)Planner aligns\ntext-visual pairs into a binary-tree layout that preserves reading order and\nspatial balance; and the (c)Painter-Commenter loop refines each panel by\nexecuting rendering code and using VLM feedback to eliminate overflow and\nensure alignment. In our comprehensive evaluation, we find that GPT-4o\noutputs-though visually appealing at first glance-often exhibit noisy text and\npoor PaperQuiz scores, and we find that reader engagement is the primary\naesthetic bottleneck, as human-designed posters rely largely on visual\nsemantics to convey meaning. Our fully open-source variants (e.g. based on the\nQwen-2.5 series) outperform existing 4o-driven multi-agent systems across\nnearly all metrics, while using 87% fewer tokens.

It is a critical component of efficient perception and\ndecision-making in humans and advanced embodied agents. Recently, the use of\nMultimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) as central planning and\ndecision-making modules in robotic systems has gained extensive attention.\nHowever, despite the importance of active perception in embodied intelligence,\nthere is little to no exploration of how MLLMs can be equipped with or learn\nactive perception capabilities. In this paper, we first provide a systematic\ndefinition of MLLM-based active perception tasks. We point out that the\nrecently proposed GPT-o3 model's zoom-in search strategy can be regarded as a\nspecial case of active perception; however, it still suffers from low search\nefficiency and inaccurate region selection. To address these issues, we propose\nACTIVE-O3, a purely reinforcement learning based training framework built on\ntop of GRPO, designed to equip MLLMs with active perception capabilities. We\nfurther establish a comprehensive benchmark suite to evaluate ACTIVE-O3 across\nboth general open-world tasks, such as small-object and dense object grounding,\nand domain-specific scenarios, including small object detection in remote\nsensing and autonomous driving, as well as fine-grained interactive\nsegmentation. In addition, ACTIVE-O3 also demonstrates strong zero-shot\nreasoning abilities on the V* Benchmark, without relying on any explicit\nreasoning data. We hope that our work can provide a simple codebase and\nevaluation protocol to facilitate future research on active perception in\nMLLMs.",

This performance ranks first among\nopen weight models, second among methods with open-source systems, and eighth\noverall, surpassing the previous best open-source model-based method by 12.33%.",

Although prompt engineering and steering are commonly\nused to intervene in model behaviors, the vast number of parameters in models\noften results in highly intertwined internal representations. This\ninterdependency can limit control precision and sometimes lead to unintended\nside effects. Recent research has explored the use of sparse autoencoders (SAE)\nto disentangle knowledge in high-dimensional spaces for steering. However,\nthese applications have been limited to toy tasks owing to the nontrivial issue\nof locating atomic knowledge components. In this paper, we propose Steering\nTarget Atoms (STA), a novel method that isolates and manipulates disentangled\nknowledge components to enhance safety. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of our approach. Further analysis reveals that steering\nexhibits superior robustness and flexibility, particularly in adversarial\nscenarios.

      "summary": "As test-time scaling becomes a pivotal research frontier in Large Language\nModels (LLMs) development, contemporary and advanced post-training\nmethodologies increasingly focus on extending the generation length of long\nChain-of-Thought (CoT) responses to enhance reasoning capabilities toward\nDeepSeek R1-like performance. However, recent studies reveal a persistent\noverthinking phenomenon in state-of-the-art reasoning models, manifesting as\nexcessive redundancy or repetitive thinking patterns in long CoT responses. To\naddress this issue, in this paper, we propose a simple yet effective two-stage\nreinforcement learning framework for achieving concise reasoning in LLMs, named\nConciseR. Specifically, the first stage, using more training steps, aims to\nincentivize the model's reasoning capabilities via Group Relative Policy\nOptimization with clip-higher and dynamic sampling components (GRPO++), and the\nsecond stage, using fewer training steps, explicitly enforces conciseness and\nimproves efficiency via Length-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization\n(L-GRPO). Significantly, ConciseR only optimizes response length once all\nrollouts of a sample are correct, following the \"walk before you run\"\nprinciple. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our ConciseR model,\nwhich generates more concise CoT reasoning responses, outperforms recent\nstate-of-the-art reasoning models with zero RL paradigm across AIME 2024,\nMATH-500, AMC 2023, Minerva, and Olympiad benchmarks.",

    "title": "Walk Before You Run! Concise LLM Reasoning via Reinforcement Learning",
    "summary": "As test-time scaling becomes a pivotal research frontier in Large Language\nModels (LLMs) development, contemporary and advanced post-training\nmethodologies increasingly focus on extending the generation length of long\nChain-of-Thought (CoT) responses to enhance reasoning capabilities toward\nDeepSeek R1-like performance. However, recent studies reveal a persistent\noverthinking phenomenon in state-of-the-art reasoning models, manifesting as\nexcessive redundancy or repetitive thinking patterns in long CoT responses. To\naddress this issue, in this paper, we propose a simple yet effective two-stage\nreinforcement learning framework for achieving concise reasoning in LLMs, named\nConciseR. Specifically, the first stage, using more training steps, aims to\nincentivize the model's reasoning capabilities via Group Relative Policy\nOptimization with clip-higher and dynamic sampling components (GRPO++), and the\nsecond stage, using fewer training steps, explicitly enforces conciseness and\nimproves efficiency via Length-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization\n(L-GRPO). Significantly, ConciseR only optimizes response length once all\nrollouts of a sample are correct, following the \"walk before you run\"\nprinciple. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our ConciseR model,\nwhich generates more concise CoT reasoning responses, outperforms recent\nstate-of-the-art reasoning models with zero RL paradigm across AIME 2024,\nMATH-500, AMC 2023, Minerva, and Olympiad benchmarks.",

In this work, we\nexplore whether such reconstruction is possible without autoregression. We show\nthat frozen LLMs can generate hundreds of accurate tokens in just one forward\npass, when provided with only two learned embeddings. This reveals a surprising\nand underexplored capability of LLMs - multi-token generation without iterative\ndecoding. We investigate the behaviour of these embeddings and provide insight\ninto the type of information they encode. We also empirically show that\nalthough these representations are not unique for a given text, they form\nconnected and local regions in embedding space - a property that suggests the\npotential of learning a dedicated encoder into that space.",

    "title": "Exploring the Latent Capacity of LLMs for One-Step Text Generation",
    "summary": "A recent study showed that large language models (LLMs) can reconstruct\nsurprisingly long texts - up to thousands of tokens - via autoregressive\ngeneration from just one specially trained input embedding. In this work, we\nexplore whether such reconstruction is possible without autoregression. We show\nthat frozen LLMs can generate hundreds of accurate tokens in just one forward\npass, when provided with only two learned embeddings. This reveals a surprising\nand underexplored capability of LLMs - multi-token generation without iterative\ndecoding. We investigate the behaviour of these embeddings and provide insight\ninto the type of information they encode. We also empirically show that\nalthough these representations are not unique for a given text, they form\nconnected and local regions in embedding space - a property that suggests the\npotential of learning a dedicated encoder into that space.",
