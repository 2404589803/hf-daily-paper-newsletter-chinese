Recent work on long Chain-of-Thought reasoning\nhas demonstrated great potential of LLMs on solving competitive problems, but\ntheir verification ability remains to be weak and not sufficiently\ninvestigated. In this paper, we propose Heimdall, the long CoT verification LLM\nthat can accurately judge the correctness of solutions. With pure reinforcement\nlearning, we boost the verification accuracy from 62.5% to 94.5% on competitive\nmath problems. By scaling with repeated sampling, the accuracy further\nincreases to 97.5%. Through human evaluation, Heimdall demonstrates impressive\ngeneralization capabilities, successfully detecting most issues in challenging\nmath proofs, the type of which is not included during training. Furthermore, we\npropose Pessimistic Verification to extend the functionality of Heimdall to\nscaling up the problem solving. It calls Heimdall to judge the solutions from a\nsolver model and based on the pessimistic principle, selects the most likely\ncorrect solution with the least uncertainty. Taking\nDeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B as the solver model, Pessimistic Verification\nimproves the solution accuracy on AIME2025 from 54.2% to 70.0% with 16x compute\nbudget and to 83.3% with more compute budget. With the stronger solver Gemini\n2.5 Pro, the score reaches 93.0%. Finally, we prototype an automatic knowledge\ndiscovery system, a ternary system where one poses questions, another provides\nsolutions, and the third verifies the solutions. Using the data synthesis work\nNuminaMath for the first two components, Heimdall effectively identifies\nproblematic records within the dataset and reveals that nearly half of the data\nis flawed, which interestingly aligns with the recent ablation studies from\nNuminaMath.",

In this paper, we\npresent a spectral analysis of layer-wise gradients induced by low/high-quality\ninstruction and reasoning data for LLM post-training. Our analysis reveals that\nwidely-studied metrics for data evaluation, e.g., IFD, InsTag, Difficulty, and\nReward, can be explained and unified by spectral properties computed from\ngradients' singular value decomposition (SVD). Specifically, higher-quality\ndata are usually associated with lower nuclear norms and higher effective\nranks. Notably, effective rank exhibits better robustness and resolution than\nnuclear norm in capturing subtle quality differences. For example, reasoning\ndata achieves substantially higher effective ranks than instruction data,\nimplying richer gradient structures on more complex tasks. Our experiments also\nhighlight that models within the same family share similar gradient patterns\nregardless of their sizes, whereas different model families diverge\nsignificantly.

Specifically, the\nadvancements of Seedream 3.0 stem from improvements across the entire pipeline,\nfrom data construction to model deployment. At the data stratum, we double the\ndataset using a defect-aware training paradigm and a dual-axis collaborative\ndata-sampling framework. Furthermore, we adopt several effective techniques\nsuch as mixed-resolution training, cross-modality RoPE, representation\nalignment loss, and resolution-aware timestep sampling in the pre-training\nphase. During the post-training stage, we utilize diversified aesthetic\ncaptions in SFT, and a VLM-based reward model with scaling, thereby achieving\noutputs that well align with human preferences. Furthermore, Seedream 3.0\npioneers a novel acceleration paradigm. By employing consistent noise\nexpectation and importance-aware timestep sampling, we achieve a 4 to 8 times\nspeedup while maintaining image quality. Seedream 3.0 demonstrates significant\nimprovements over Seedream 2.0: it enhances overall capabilities, in particular\nfor text-rendering in complicated Chinese characters which is important to\nprofessional typography generation.

While numerous efforts have been devoted to static image\nscenarios, ensuring temporal coherence in video-based normal estimation remains\na formidable challenge. Instead of merely augmenting existing methods with\ntemporal components, we present NormalCrafter to leverage the inherent temporal\npriors of video diffusion models. To secure high-fidelity normal estimation\nacross sequences, we propose Semantic Feature Regularization (SFR), which\naligns diffusion features with semantic cues, encouraging the model to\nconcentrate on the intrinsic semantics of the scene. Moreover, we introduce a\ntwo-stage training protocol that leverages both latent and pixel space learning\nto preserve spatial accuracy while maintaining long temporal context. Extensive\nevaluations demonstrate the efficacy of our method, showcasing a superior\nperformance in generating temporally consistent normal sequences with intricate\ndetails from diverse videos.",

      "summary": "The recently proposed Forgetting Transformer (FoX) incorporates a forget gate\ninto softmax attention and has shown consistently better or on-par performance\ncompared to the standard RoPE-based Transformer. Notably, many attention heads\nin FoX tend to forget quickly, causing their output at each timestep to rely\nprimarily on the local context. Based on this observation, we propose Adaptive\nComputation Pruning (ACP) for FoX, a method that dynamically prunes\ncomputations involving input-output dependencies that are strongly decayed by\nthe forget gate. This is achieved using a dynamically set pruning threshold\nthat ensures that the pruned attention weights remain negligible. We apply ACP\nto language model pretraining with FoX and show it consistently reduces the\nnumber of FLOPs in softmax attention by around 70% across different model sizes\nand context lengths, resulting in a roughly 10% to 35% improvement in training\nthroughput. Furthermore, longer context lengths yield greater computational\nsavings. All these speed improvements are achieved without any performance\ndegradation. We also perform several analyses to provide deeper insights into\nour method, such as examining the pruning patterns and analyzing the\ndistribution of FLOP savings across different attention heads.

Current methods, often using Reinforcement Learning (RL),\ntypically focus on query formulation or reasoning over results, without\nexplicitly encouraging persistence after a failed search. We introduce ReZero\n(Retry-Zero), a novel RL framework that directly rewards the act of retrying a\nsearch query following an initial unsuccessful attempt. This incentivizes the\nLLM to explore alternative queries rather than prematurely halting. ReZero\ndemonstrates significant improvement, achieving 46.88% accuracy compared to a\n25% baseline. By rewarding persistence, ReZero enhances LLM robustness in\ncomplex information-seeking scenarios where initial queries may prove\ninsufficient.",
