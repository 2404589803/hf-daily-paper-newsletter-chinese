      "summary": "Reasoning Language Models, capable of extended chain-of-thought reasoning,\nhave demonstrated remarkable performance on tasks requiring complex logical\ninference. However, applying elaborate reasoning for all queries often results\nin substantial computational inefficiencies, particularly when many problems\nadmit straightforward solutions. This motivates an open question: Can LLMs\nlearn when to think? To answer this, we propose Thinkless, a learnable\nframework that empowers an LLM to adaptively select between short-form and\nlong-form reasoning, based on both task complexity and the model's ability.\nThinkless is trained under a reinforcement learning paradigm and employs two\ncontrol tokens, <short> for concise responses and <think> for detailed\nreasoning. At the core of our method is a Decoupled Group Relative Policy\nOptimization (DeGRPO) algorithm, which decomposes the learning objective of\nhybrid reasoning into two components: (1) a control token loss that governs the\nselection of the reasoning mode, and (2) a response loss that improves the\naccuracy of the generated answers. This decoupled formulation enables\nfine-grained control over the contributions of each objective, stabilizing\ntraining and effectively preventing collapse observed in vanilla GRPO.\nEmpirically, on several benchmarks such as Minerva Algebra, MATH-500, and\nGSM8K, Thinkless is able to reduce the usage of long-chain thinking by 50% -\n90%, significantly improving the efficiency of Reasoning Language Models.

    "title": "Thinkless: LLM Learns When to Think",
    "summary": "Reasoning Language Models, capable of extended chain-of-thought reasoning,\nhave demonstrated remarkable performance on tasks requiring complex logical\ninference. However, applying elaborate reasoning for all queries often results\nin substantial computational inefficiencies, particularly when many problems\nadmit straightforward solutions. This motivates an open question: Can LLMs\nlearn when to think? To answer this, we propose Thinkless, a learnable\nframework that empowers an LLM to adaptively select between short-form and\nlong-form reasoning, based on both task complexity and the model's ability.\nThinkless is trained under a reinforcement learning paradigm and employs two\ncontrol tokens, <short> for concise responses and <think> for detailed\nreasoning. At the core of our method is a Decoupled Group Relative Policy\nOptimization (DeGRPO) algorithm, which decomposes the learning objective of\nhybrid reasoning into two components: (1) a control token loss that governs the\nselection of the reasoning mode, and (2) a response loss that improves the\naccuracy of the generated answers. This decoupled formulation enables\nfine-grained control over the contributions of each objective, stabilizing\ntraining and effectively preventing collapse observed in vanilla GRPO.\nEmpirically, on several benchmarks such as Minerva Algebra, MATH-500, and\nGSM8K, Thinkless is able to reduce the usage of long-chain thinking by 50% -\n90%, significantly improving the efficiency of Reasoning Language Models.

However, existing methods rely\nlargely on 2D-rendered pose images for motion guidance, which limits\ngeneralization and discards essential 3D information for open-world animation.\nTo tackle this problem, we propose MTVCrafter (Motion Tokenization Video\nCrafter), the first framework that directly models raw 3D motion sequences\n(i.e., 4D motion) for human image animation. Specifically, we introduce 4DMoT\n(4D motion tokenizer) to quantize 3D motion sequences into 4D motion tokens.\nCompared to 2D-rendered pose images, 4D motion tokens offer more robust\nspatio-temporal cues and avoid strict pixel-level alignment between pose image\nand character, enabling more flexible and disentangled control. Then, we\nintroduce MV-DiT (Motion-aware Video DiT). By designing unique motion attention\nwith 4D positional encodings, MV-DiT can effectively leverage motion tokens as\n4D compact yet expressive context for human image animation in the complex 3D\nworld. Hence, it marks a significant step forward in this field and opens a new\ndirection for pose-guided human video generation. Experiments show that our\nMTVCrafter achieves state-of-the-art results with an FID-VID of 6.98,\nsurpassing the second-best by 65%.

To explore this\nmethodology, we focused on validating chemical formulas within a single,\ncomplex test paper with known textual and image-based errors. Several prompting\nstrategies were evaluated: while basic prompts proved unreliable, an approach\nadapting PWP structures to rigorously condition the LLM's analytical mindset\nappeared to improve textual error identification with both models. Notably,\nthis method also guided Gemini 2.5 Pro to repeatedly identify a subtle\nimage-based formula error previously overlooked during manual review, a task\nwhere ChatGPT Plus o3 failed in our tests. These preliminary findings highlight\nspecific LLM operational modes that impede detail-oriented validation and\nsuggest that PWP-informed context conditioning offers a promising and highly\naccessible technique for developing more robust LLM-driven analytical\nworkflows, particularly for tasks requiring meticulous error detection in\nscientific and technical documents. Extensive validation beyond this limited\nPoC is necessary to ascertain broader applicability.",
