RPT offers a scalable method to leverage vast\namounts of text data for general-purpose RL, rather than relying on\ndomain-specific annotated answers. By incentivizing the capability of\nnext-token reasoning, RPT significantly improves the language modeling accuracy\nof predicting the next tokens. Moreover, RPT provides a strong pre-trained\nfoundation for further reinforcement fine-tuning. The scaling curves show that\nincreased training compute consistently improves the next-token prediction\naccuracy. The results position RPT as an effective and promising scaling\nparadigm to advance language model pre-training.",

Specifically, in terms of\nmodel architecture, we propose InfLLM v2, a trainable sparse attention\nmechanism that accelerates both prefilling and decoding phases for long-context\nprocessing. Regarding training data, we propose UltraClean, an efficient and\naccurate pre-training data filtering and generation strategy, and UltraChat v2,\na comprehensive supervised fine-tuning dataset.

Regarding training algorithms, we propose ModelTunnel v2 for efficient\npre-training strategy search, and improve existing post-training methods by\nintroducing chunk-wise rollout for load-balanced reinforcement learning and\ndata-efficient tenary LLM, BitCPM. Regarding inference systems, we propose\nCPM.cu that integrates sparse attention, model quantization, and speculative\nsampling to achieve efficient prefilling and decoding.

Sufficient evaluation results show that MiniCPM4\noutperforms open-source models of similar size across multiple benchmarks,\nhighlighting both its efficiency and effectiveness. Notably, MiniCPM4-8B\ndemonstrates significant speed improvements over Qwen3-8B when processing long\nsequences.

      "summary": "Existing safety assurance research has primarily focused on training-phase\nalignment to instill safe behaviors into LLMs. However, recent studies have\nexposed these methods' susceptibility to diverse jailbreak attacks.\nConcurrently, inference scaling has significantly advanced LLM reasoning\ncapabilities but remains unexplored in the context of safety assurance.\nAddressing this gap, our work pioneers inference scaling for robust and\neffective LLM safety against emerging threats. We reveal that conventional\ninference scaling techniques, despite their success in reasoning tasks, perform\npoorly in safety contexts, even falling short of basic approaches like\nBest-of-N Sampling. We attribute this inefficiency to a newly identified\nchallenge, the exploration--efficiency dilemma, arising from the high\ncomputational overhead associated with frequent process reward model (PRM)\nevaluations. To overcome this dilemma, we propose SAFFRON, a novel inference\nscaling paradigm tailored explicitly for safety assurance. Central to our\napproach is the introduction of a multifurcation reward model (MRM) that\nsignificantly reduces the required number of reward model evaluations. To\noperationalize this paradigm, we further propose: (i) a partial supervision\ntraining objective for MRM, (ii) a conservative exploration constraint to\nprevent out-of-distribution explorations, and (iii) a Trie-based key--value\ncaching strategy that facilitates cache sharing across sequences during tree\nsearch. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method.\nAdditionally, we publicly release our trained multifurcation reward model\n(Saffron-1) and the accompanying token-level safety reward dataset (Safety4M)\nto accelerate future research in LLM safety. Our code, model, and data are\npublicly available at https://github.com/q-rz/saffron , and our project\nhomepage is at https://q-rz.github.io/p/saffron .",

    "title": "Saffron-1: Towards an Inference Scaling Paradigm for LLM Safety\n  Assurance",
    "summary": "Existing safety assurance research has primarily focused on training-phase\nalignment to instill safe behaviors into LLMs. However, recent studies have\nexposed these methods' susceptibility to diverse jailbreak attacks.\nConcurrently, inference scaling has significantly advanced LLM reasoning\ncapabilities but remains unexplored in the context of safety assurance.\nAddressing this gap, our work pioneers inference scaling for robust and\neffective LLM safety against emerging threats. We reveal that conventional\ninference scaling techniques, despite their success in reasoning tasks, perform\npoorly in safety contexts, even falling short of basic approaches like\nBest-of-N Sampling. We attribute this inefficiency to a newly identified\nchallenge, the exploration--efficiency dilemma, arising from the high\ncomputational overhead associated with frequent process reward model (PRM)\nevaluations. To overcome this dilemma, we propose SAFFRON, a novel inference\nscaling paradigm tailored explicitly for safety assurance. Central to our\napproach is the introduction of a multifurcation reward model (MRM) that\nsignificantly reduces the required number of reward model evaluations. To\noperationalize this paradigm, we further propose: (i) a partial supervision\ntraining objective for MRM, (ii) a conservative exploration constraint to\nprevent out-of-distribution explorations, and (iii) a Trie-based key--value\ncaching strategy that facilitates cache sharing across sequences during tree\nsearch. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method.\nAdditionally, we publicly release our trained multifurcation reward model\n(Saffron-1) and the accompanying token-level safety reward dataset (Safety4M)\nto accelerate future research in LLM safety. Our code, model, and data are\npublicly available at https://github.com/q-rz/saffron , and our project\nhomepage is at https://q-rz.github.io/p/saffron .",

      "summary": "Optical Chemical Structure Recognition (OCSR) is crucial for digitizing\nchemical knowledge by converting molecular images into machine-readable\nformats. While recent vision-language models (VLMs) have shown potential in\nthis task, their image-captioning approach often struggles with complex\nmolecular structures and inconsistent annotations. To overcome these\nchallenges, we introduce GTR-Mol-VLM, a novel framework featuring two key\ninnovations: (1) the Graph Traversal as Visual Chain of Thought\nmechanism that emulates human reasoning by incrementally parsing molecular\ngraphs through sequential atom-bond predictions, and (2) the data-centric\nprinciple of Faithfully Recognize What You've Seen, which addresses\nthe mismatch between abbreviated structures in images and their expanded\nannotations. To support model development, we constructed GTR-CoT-1.3M, a\nlarge-scale instruction-tuning dataset with meticulously corrected annotations,\nand introduced MolRec-Bench, the first benchmark designed for a fine-grained\nevaluation of graph-parsing accuracy in OCSR. Comprehensive experiments\ndemonstrate that GTR-Mol-VLM achieves superior results compared to specialist\nmodels, chemistry-domain VLMs, and commercial general-purpose VLMs. Notably, in\nscenarios involving molecular images with functional group abbreviations,\nGTR-Mol-VLM outperforms the second-best baseline by approximately 14 percentage\npoints, both in SMILES-based and graph-based metrics. We hope that this work\nwill drive OCSR technology to more effectively meet real-world needs, thereby\nadvancing the fields of cheminformatics and AI for Science. We will release\nGTR-CoT at https://github.com/opendatalab/GTR-CoT.",

    "title": "GTR-CoT: Graph Traversal as Visual Chain of Thought for Molecular\n  Structure Recognition",
    "summary": "Optical Chemical Structure Recognition (OCSR) is crucial for digitizing\nchemical knowledge by converting molecular images into machine-readable\nformats. While recent vision-language models (VLMs) have shown potential in\nthis task, their image-captioning approach often struggles with complex\nmolecular structures and inconsistent annotations. To overcome these\nchallenges, we introduce GTR-Mol-VLM, a novel framework featuring two key\ninnovations: (1) the Graph Traversal as Visual Chain of Thought\nmechanism that emulates human reasoning by incrementally parsing molecular\ngraphs through sequential atom-bond predictions, and (2) the data-centric\nprinciple of Faithfully Recognize What You've Seen, which addresses\nthe mismatch between abbreviated structures in images and their expanded\nannotations. To support model development, we constructed GTR-CoT-1.3M, a\nlarge-scale instruction-tuning dataset with meticulously corrected annotations,\nand introduced MolRec-Bench, the first benchmark designed for a fine-grained\nevaluation of graph-parsing accuracy in OCSR. Comprehensive experiments\ndemonstrate that GTR-Mol-VLM achieves superior results compared to specialist\nmodels, chemistry-domain VLMs, and commercial general-purpose VLMs. Notably, in\nscenarios involving molecular images with functional group abbreviations,\nGTR-Mol-VLM outperforms the second-best baseline by approximately 14 percentage\npoints, both in SMILES-based and graph-based metrics. We hope that this work\nwill drive OCSR technology to more effectively meet real-world needs, thereby\nadvancing the fields of cheminformatics and AI for Science. We will release\nGTR-CoT at https://github.com/opendatalab/GTR-CoT.",

We also investigate the\nreasoning traces in more depth, studying the patterns of explored solutions and\nanalyzing the models' computational behavior, shedding light on their\nstrengths, limitations, and raising questions about their reasoning\ncapabilities.",

In this paper, we propose PolyVivid, a\nmulti-subject video customization framework that enables flexible and\nidentity-consistent generation. To establish accurate correspondences between\nsubject images and textual entities, we design a VLLM-based text-image fusion\nmodule that embeds visual identities into the textual space for precise\ngrounding. To further enhance identity preservation and subject interaction, we\npropose a 3D-RoPE-based enhancement module that enables structured\nbidirectional fusion between text and image embeddings.

    "summary": "Despite recent advances in video generation, existing models still lack\nfine-grained controllability, especially for multi-subject customization with\nconsistent identity and interaction. In this paper, we propose PolyVivid, a\nmulti-subject video customization framework that enables flexible and\nidentity-consistent generation. To establish accurate correspondences between\nsubject images and textual entities, we design a VLLM-based text-image fusion\nmodule that embeds visual identities into the textual space for precise\ngrounding. To further enhance identity preservation and subject interaction, we\npropose a 3D-RoPE-based enhancement module that enables structured\nbidirectional fusion between text and image embeddings. Moreover, we develop an\nattention-inherited identity injection module to effectively inject fused\nidentity features into the video generation process, mitigating identity drift.\nFinally, we construct an MLLM-based data pipeline that combines MLLM-based\ngrounding, segmentation, and a clique-based subject consolidation strategy to\nproduce high-quality multi-subject data, effectively enhancing subject\ndistinction and reducing ambiguity in downstream video generation. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that PolyVivid achieves superior performance in\nidentity fidelity, video realism, and subject alignment, outperforming existing\nopen-source and commercial baselines.",

      "summary": "Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable\ncapabilities across diverse domains, particularly in mathematical reasoning,\namid which geometry problem solving remains a challenging area where auxiliary\nconstruction plays a enssential role. Existing approaches either achieve\nsuboptimal performance or rely on massive LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o), incurring\nmassive computational costs. We posit that reinforcement learning with\nverifiable reward (e.g., GRPO) offers a promising direction for training\nsmaller models that effectively combine auxiliary construction with robust\ngeometric reasoning.

    "summary": "Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable\ncapabilities across diverse domains, particularly in mathematical reasoning,\namid which geometry problem solving remains a challenging area where auxiliary\nconstruction plays a enssential role. Existing approaches either achieve\nsuboptimal performance or rely on massive LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o), incurring\nmassive computational costs. We posit that reinforcement learning with\nverifiable reward (e.g., GRPO) offers a promising direction for training\nsmaller models that effectively combine auxiliary construction with robust\ngeometric reasoning. However, directly applying GRPO to geometric reasoning\npresents fundamental limitations due to its dependence on unconditional\nrewards, which leads to indiscriminate and counterproductive auxiliary\nconstructions. To address these challenges, we propose Group Contrastive Policy\nOptimization (GCPO), a novel reinforcement learning framework featuring two key\ninnovations: (1) Group Contrastive Masking, which adaptively provides positive\nor negative reward signals for auxiliary construction based on contextual\nutility, and a (2) length reward that promotes longer reasoning chains.\nBuilding on GCPO, we develop GeometryZero, a family of affordable-size\ngeometric reasoning models that judiciously determine when to employ auxiliary\nconstruction.

Collecting such instructions is crucial for evaluating and\nmitigating over-refusals, but existing instruction curation methods, like\nmanual creation or instruction rewriting, either lack scalability or fail to\nproduce sufficiently diverse and effective refusal-inducing prompts. To address\nthese limitations, we introduce EVOREFUSE, a prompt optimization approach that\ngenerates diverse pseudo-malicious instructions consistently eliciting\nconfident refusals across LLMs. EVOREFUSE employs an evolutionary algorithm\nexploring the instruction space in more diverse directions than existing\nmethods via mutation strategies and recombination, and iteratively evolves seed\ninstructions to maximize evidence lower bound on LLM refusal probability. Using\nEVOREFUSE, we create two novel datasets: EVOREFUSE-TEST, a benchmark of 582\npseudo-malicious instructions that outperforms the next-best benchmark with\n140.41% higher average refusal triggering rate across 9 LLMs, 34.86% greater\nlexical diversity, and 40.03% improved LLM response confidence scores; and\nEVOREFUSE-ALIGN, which provides 3,000 pseudo-malicious instructions with\nresponses for supervised and preference-based alignment training.\nLLAMA3.1-8B-INSTRUCT supervisedly fine-tuned on EVOREFUSE-ALIGN achieves up to\n14.31% fewer over-refusals than models trained on the second-best alignment\ndataset, without compromising safety. Our analysis with EVOREFUSE-TEST reveals\nmodels trigger over-refusals by overly focusing on sensitive keywords while\nignoring broader context.",
