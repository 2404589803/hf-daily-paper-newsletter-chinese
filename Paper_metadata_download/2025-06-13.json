However, existing\ndiffusion-based restoration methods, despite great success in natural image\nrestoration, often struggle to faithfully reconstruct textual regions in\ndegraded images. Those methods frequently generate plausible but incorrect\ntext-like patterns, a phenomenon we refer to as text-image hallucination.

To tackle this task, we present SA-Text, a large-scale\nbenchmark of 100K high-quality scene images densely annotated with diverse and\ncomplex text instances. Furthermore, we propose a multi-task diffusion\nframework, called TeReDiff, that integrates internal features from diffusion\nmodels into a text-spotting module, enabling both components to benefit from\njoint training. This allows for the extraction of rich text representations,\nwhich are utilized as prompts in subsequent denoising steps. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms\nstate-of-the-art restoration methods, achieving significant gains in text\nrecognition accuracy.

      "summary": "Constructing large-scale datasets for the GitHub issue resolution task is\ncrucial for both training and evaluating the software engineering capabilities\nof Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the traditional process for creating\nsuch benchmarks is notoriously challenging and labor-intensive, particularly in\nthe stages of setting up evaluation environments, grading test outcomes, and\nvalidating task instances. In this paper, we propose SWE-Factory, an automated\npipeline designed to address these challenges. To tackle these issues, our\npipeline integrates three core automated components. First, we introduce\nSWE-Builder, a multi-agent system that automates evaluation environment\nconstruction, which employs four specialized agents that work in a\ncollaborative, iterative loop and leverages an environment memory pool to\nenhance efficiency. Second, we introduce a standardized, exit-code-based\ngrading method that eliminates the need for manually writing custom parsers.\nFinally, we automate the fail2pass validation process using these reliable exit\ncode signals. Experiments on 671 issues across four programming languages show\nthat our pipeline can effectively construct valid task instances; for example,\nwith GPT-4.1-mini, our SWE-Builder constructs 269 valid instances at 0.045 per\ninstance, while with Gemini-2.5-flash, it achieves comparable performance at\nthe lowest cost of 0.024 per instance.

    "summary": "Constructing large-scale datasets for the GitHub issue resolution task is\ncrucial for both training and evaluating the software engineering capabilities\nof Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the traditional process for creating\nsuch benchmarks is notoriously challenging and labor-intensive, particularly in\nthe stages of setting up evaluation environments, grading test outcomes, and\nvalidating task instances. In this paper, we propose SWE-Factory, an automated\npipeline designed to address these challenges. To tackle these issues, our\npipeline integrates three core automated components. First, we introduce\nSWE-Builder, a multi-agent system that automates evaluation environment\nconstruction, which employs four specialized agents that work in a\ncollaborative, iterative loop and leverages an environment memory pool to\nenhance efficiency. Second, we introduce a standardized, exit-code-based\ngrading method that eliminates the need for manually writing custom parsers.\nFinally, we automate the fail2pass validation process using these reliable exit\ncode signals. Experiments on 671 issues across four programming languages show\nthat our pipeline can effectively construct valid task instances; for example,\nwith GPT-4.1-mini, our SWE-Builder constructs 269 valid instances at 0.045 per\ninstance, while with Gemini-2.5-flash, it achieves comparable performance at\nthe lowest cost of 0.024 per instance. We also demonstrate that our\nexit-code-based grading achieves 100% accuracy compared to manual inspection,\nand our automated fail2pass validation reaches a precision of 0.92 and a recall\nof 1.00. We hope our automated pipeline will accelerate the collection of\nlarge-scale, high-quality GitHub issue resolution datasets for both training\nand evaluation.

Current AI tools automate parts of the workflow, but struggle to\naccurately incorporate user-supplied assets, maintain editability, and achieve\nprofessional visual appeal. Commercial systems, like Canva Magic Design, rely\non vast template libraries, which are impractical for replicate. In this paper,\nwe introduce CreatiPoster, a framework that generates editable, multi-layer\ncompositions from optional natural-language instructions or assets. A protocol\nmodel, an RGBA large multimodal model, first produces a JSON specification\ndetailing every layer (text or asset) with precise layout, hierarchy, content\nand style, plus a concise background prompt. A conditional background model\nthen synthesizes a coherent background conditioned on this rendered foreground\nlayers. We construct a benchmark with automated metrics for graphic-design\ngeneration and show that CreatiPoster surpasses leading open-source approaches\nand proprietary commercial systems. To catalyze further research, we release a\ncopyright-free corpus of 100,000 multi-layer designs.

We answer this question with Resa,\na family of 1.5B reasoning models trained via a novel and efficient sparse\nautoencoder tuning (SAE-Tuning) procedure. This method first trains an SAE to\ncapture reasoning abilities from a source model, and then uses the trained SAE\nto guide a standard supervised fine-tuning process to elicit such abilities in\na target model, all using verified question-answer data without any reasoning\ntraces. Notably, when applied to certain base models before further RL\npost-training, SAE-Tuning retains >97% of its RL-trained counterpart's\nreasoning performance while reducing training costs by >2000x to roughly \\1\nand training time by >450x to around 20 minutes. Furthermore, when applied to\nlightly RL-trained models (e.g., within 1 hour on 2 GPUs), it enables reasoning\nperformance such as 43.33% Pass@1 on AIME24 and 90% Pass@1 on AMC23 for only\naround 1 additional cost. Surprisingly, the reasoning abilities extracted via\nSAEs are potentially both generalizable and modular. Generality means abilities\nextracted from one dataset still elevate performance on a larger and\noverlapping corpus. Modularity means abilities extracted from Qwen or Qwen-Math\ncan be attached to the R1-Distill model at test time, without any retraining,\nand yield comparable gains. Extensive ablations validate these findings and all\nartifacts are fully open-sourced.",

However, best practices for RL in\ninstruction following remain underexplored. In this work, we explore the\nverification challenge in RL for instruction following and propose VerIF, a\nverification method that combines rule-based code verification with LLM-based\nverification from a large reasoning model (e.g., QwQ-32B). To support this\napproach, we construct a high-quality instruction-following dataset,\nVerInstruct, containing approximately 22,000 instances with associated\nverification signals. We apply RL training with VerIF to two models, achieving\nsignificant improvements across several representative instruction-following\nbenchmarks. The trained models reach state-of-the-art performance among models\nof comparable size and generalize well to unseen constraints. We further\nobserve that their general capabilities remain unaffected, suggesting that RL\nwith VerIF can be integrated into existing RL recipes to enhance overall model\nperformance. We have released our datasets, codes, and models to facilitate\nfuture research at https://github.com/THU-KEG/VerIF.",

    "title": "VerIF: Verification Engineering for Reinforcement Learning in\n  Instruction Following",
    "summary": "Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has become a key\ntechnique for enhancing large language models (LLMs), with verification\nengineering playing a central role. However, best practices for RL in\ninstruction following remain underexplored. In this work, we explore the\nverification challenge in RL for instruction following and propose VerIF, a\nverification method that combines rule-based code verification with LLM-based\nverification from a large reasoning model (e.g., QwQ-32B). To support this\napproach, we construct a high-quality instruction-following dataset,\nVerInstruct, containing approximately 22,000 instances with associated\nverification signals. We apply RL training with VerIF to two models, achieving\nsignificant improvements across several representative instruction-following\nbenchmarks. The trained models reach state-of-the-art performance among models\nof comparable size and generalize well to unseen constraints. We further\nobserve that their general capabilities remain unaffected, suggesting that RL\nwith VerIF can be integrated into existing RL recipes to enhance overall model\nperformance. We have released our datasets, codes, and models to facilitate\nfuture research at https://github.com/THU-KEG/VerIF.",

To bridge this gap, we\npropose MoveGCL, a scalable and privacy-preserving framework for training\nmobility foundation models via generative continual learning. Without sharing\nraw data, MoveGCL enables decentralized and progressive model evolution by\nreplaying synthetic trajectories generated from a frozen teacher model, and\nreinforces knowledge retention through a tailored distillation strategy that\nmitigates catastrophic forgetting. To address the heterogeneity of mobility\npatterns, MoveGCL incorporates a Mixture-of-Experts Transformer with a\nmobility-aware expert routing mechanism, and employs a layer-wise progressive\nadaptation strategy to stabilize continual updates. Experiments on six\nreal-world urban datasets demonstrate that MoveGCL achieves performance\ncomparable to joint training and significantly outperforms federated learning\nbaselines, while offering strong privacy protection.

Experiments with four LLMs show that using\nprofile information consistently helps generate captions closer to the original\nauthor-written ones.
