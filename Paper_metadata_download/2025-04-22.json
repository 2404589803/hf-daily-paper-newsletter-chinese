      "summary": "Current Large Language Models (LLMs) often undergo supervised fine-tuning\n(SFT) to acquire tool use capabilities. However, SFT struggles to generalize to\nunfamiliar or complex tool use scenarios. Recent advancements in reinforcement\nlearning (RL), particularly with R1-like models, have demonstrated promising\nreasoning and generalization abilities. Yet, reward design for tool use\npresents unique challenges: multiple tools may be invoked with diverse\nparameters, and coarse-grained reward signals, such as answer matching, fail to\noffer the finegrained feedback required for effective learning. In this work,\nwe present the first comprehensive study on reward design for tool selection\nand application tasks within the RL paradigm. We systematically explore a wide\nrange of reward strategies, analyzing their types, scales, granularity, and\ntemporal dynamics. Building on these insights, we propose a principled reward\ndesign tailored for tool use tasks and apply it to train LLMs using Group\nRelative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Empirical evaluations across diverse\nbenchmarks demonstrate that our approach yields robust, scalable, and stable\ntraining, achieving a 17% improvement over base models and a 15% gain over SFT\nmodels. These results highlight the critical role of thoughtful reward design\nin enhancing the tool use capabilities and generalization performance of LLMs.\nAll the codes are released to facilitate future research.",

    "title": "ToolRL: Reward is All Tool Learning Needs",
    "summary": "Current Large Language Models (LLMs) often undergo supervised fine-tuning\n(SFT) to acquire tool use capabilities. However, SFT struggles to generalize to\nunfamiliar or complex tool use scenarios. Recent advancements in reinforcement\nlearning (RL), particularly with R1-like models, have demonstrated promising\nreasoning and generalization abilities. Yet, reward design for tool use\npresents unique challenges: multiple tools may be invoked with diverse\nparameters, and coarse-grained reward signals, such as answer matching, fail to\noffer the finegrained feedback required for effective learning. In this work,\nwe present the first comprehensive study on reward design for tool selection\nand application tasks within the RL paradigm. We systematically explore a wide\nrange of reward strategies, analyzing their types, scales, granularity, and\ntemporal dynamics. Building on these insights, we propose a principled reward\ndesign tailored for tool use tasks and apply it to train LLMs using Group\nRelative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Empirical evaluations across diverse\nbenchmarks demonstrate that our approach yields robust, scalable, and stable\ntraining, achieving a 17% improvement over base models and a 15% gain over SFT\nmodels. These results highlight the critical role of thoughtful reward design\nin enhancing the tool use capabilities and generalization performance of LLMs.\nAll the codes are released to facilitate future research.",

Compared with traditional reinforcement learning with human feedback\n(RLHF) or pairwise preference approaches such as direct preference optimization\n(DPO), DRAGON is more flexible. It can optimize reward functions that evaluate\neither individual examples or distributions of them, making it compatible with\na broad spectrum of instance-wise, instance-to-distribution, and\ndistribution-to-distribution rewards. Leveraging this versatility, we construct\nnovel reward functions by selecting an encoder and a set of reference examples\nto create an exemplar distribution. When cross-modality encoders such as CLAP\nare used, the reference examples may be of a different modality (e.g., text\nversus audio). Then, DRAGON gathers online and on-policy generations, scores\nthem to construct a positive demonstration set and a negative set, and\nleverages the contrast between the two sets to maximize the reward. For\nevaluation, we fine-tune an audio-domain text-to-music diffusion model with 20\ndifferent reward functions, including a custom music aesthetics model, CLAP\nscore, Vendi diversity, and Frechet audio distance (FAD). We further compare\ninstance-wise (per-song) and full-dataset FAD settings while ablating multiple\nFAD encoders and reference sets. Over all 20 target rewards, DRAGON achieves an\n81.45% average win rate. Moreover, reward functions based on exemplar sets\nindeed enhance generations and are comparable to model-based rewards. With an\nappropriate exemplar set, DRAGON achieves a 60.95% human-voted music quality\nwin rate without training on human preference annotations.

Their true form only reveals\nitself when seen from a specific viewpoint, which can be through some\ncatadioptric device like a mirror or a lens. While the construction of these\nmathematical devices can be traced back to as early as the 17th century, they\nare only interpretable when viewed from a specific vantage point and tend to\nlose meaning when seen normally. In this paper, we revisit these famous optical\nillusions with a generative twist. With the help of latent rectified flow\nmodels, we propose a method to create anamorphic images that still retain a\nvalid interpretation when viewed directly. To this end, we introduce Laplacian\nPyramid Warping, a frequency-aware image warping technique key to generating\nhigh-quality visuals. Our work extends Visual Anagrams (arXiv:2311.17919) to\nlatent space models and to a wider range of spatial transforms, enabling the\ncreation of novel generative perceptual illusions.",

      "summary": "We introduce TAPIP3D, a novel approach for long-term 3D point tracking in\nmonocular RGB and RGB-D videos. TAPIP3D represents videos as camera-stabilized\nspatio-temporal feature clouds, leveraging depth and camera motion information\nto lift 2D video features into a 3D world space where camera motion is\neffectively canceled. TAPIP3D iteratively refines multi-frame 3D motion\nestimates within this stabilized representation, enabling robust tracking over\nextended periods. To manage the inherent irregularities of 3D point\ndistributions, we propose a Local Pair Attention mechanism. This 3D\ncontextualization strategy effectively exploits spatial relationships in 3D,\nforming informative feature neighborhoods for precise 3D trajectory estimation.\nOur 3D-centric approach significantly outperforms existing 3D point tracking\nmethods and even enhances 2D tracking accuracy compared to conventional 2D\npixel trackers when accurate depth is available. It supports inference in both\ncamera coordinates (i.e., unstabilized) and world coordinates, and our results\ndemonstrate that compensating for camera motion improves tracking performance.\nOur approach replaces the conventional 2D square correlation neighborhoods used\nin prior 2D and 3D trackers, leading to more robust and accurate results across\nvarious 3D point tracking benchmarks.
