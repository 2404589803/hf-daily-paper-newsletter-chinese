In long-term and\nmulti-turn agent tasks, existing approaches driven solely by outcome rewards\noften suffer from the problem of sparse supervision. To address the challenge,\nwe propose Tree-based Group Relative Policy Optimization (Tree-GRPO), a grouped\nagent RL method based on tree search, where each tree node represents the\ncomplete agent interaction step. By sharing common prefixes, the tree search\nsampling increases the number of rollouts achievable within a fixed budget of\ntokens or tool calls. Moreover, we find that the tree-structured trajectory\nnaturally allows the construction of step-wise process supervised signals even\nusing only the outcome reward. Based on this, Tree-GRPO estimates the grouped\nrelative advantages both on intra-tree and inter-tree levels. Through\ntheoretical analysis, we demonstrate that the objective of intra-tree level\ngroup relative policy optimization is equivalent to that of step-level direct\npreference learning.

While traditional hair modeling methods focus on\nrealistic hair using strand-based or volumetric representations, anime\nhairstyle exhibits highly stylized, piecewise-structured geometry that\nchallenges existing techniques. Existing works often rely on dense mesh\nmodeling or hand-crafted spline curves, making them inefficient for editing and\nunsuitable for scalable learning. CHARM introduces a compact, invertible\ncontrol-point-based parameterization, where a sequence of control points\nrepresents each hair card, and each point is encoded with only five geometric\nparameters. This efficient and accurate representation supports both\nartist-friendly design and learning-based generation. Built upon this\nrepresentation, CHARM introduces an autoregressive generative framework that\neffectively generates anime hairstyles from input images or point clouds. By\ninterpreting anime hairstyles as a sequential \"hair language\", our\nautoregressive transformer captures both local geometry and global hairstyle\ntopology, resulting in high-fidelity anime hairstyle creation. To facilitate\nboth training and evaluation of anime hairstyle generation, we construct\nAnimeHair, a large-scale dataset of 37K high-quality anime hairstyles with\nseparated hair cards and processed mesh data.

      "summary": "This paper introduces a simple and scalable approach to improve the data\nefficiency of large language model (LLM) training by augmenting existing text\ndata with thinking trajectories. The compute for pre-training LLMs has been\ngrowing at an unprecedented rate, while the availability of high-quality data\nremains limited. Consequently, maximizing the utility of available data\nconstitutes a significant research challenge. A primary impediment is that\ncertain high-quality tokens are difficult to learn given a fixed model\ncapacity, as the underlying rationale for a single token can be exceptionally\ncomplex and deep. To address this issue, we propose Thinking augmented\nPre-Training (TPT), a universal methodology that augments text with\nautomatically generated thinking trajectories. Such augmentation effectively\nincreases the volume of the training data and makes high-quality tokens more\nlearnable through step-by-step reasoning and decomposition. We apply TPT across\ndiverse training configurations up to 100B tokens, encompassing pre-training\nwith both constrained and abundant data, as well as mid-training from strong\nopen-source checkpoints. Experimental results indicate that our method\nsubstantially improves the performance of LLMs across various model sizes and\nfamilies. Notably, TPT enhances the data efficiency of LLM pre-training by a\nfactor of 3. For a 3B parameter model, it improves the post-training\nperformance by over 10% on several challenging reasoning benchmarks.",

    "title": "Thinking Augmented Pre-training",
    "summary": "This paper introduces a simple and scalable approach to improve the data\nefficiency of large language model (LLM) training by augmenting existing text\ndata with thinking trajectories. The compute for pre-training LLMs has been\ngrowing at an unprecedented rate, while the availability of high-quality data\nremains limited. Consequently, maximizing the utility of available data\nconstitutes a significant research challenge. A primary impediment is that\ncertain high-quality tokens are difficult to learn given a fixed model\ncapacity, as the underlying rationale for a single token can be exceptionally\ncomplex and deep. To address this issue, we propose Thinking augmented\nPre-Training (TPT), a universal methodology that augments text with\nautomatically generated thinking trajectories. Such augmentation effectively\nincreases the volume of the training data and makes high-quality tokens more\nlearnable through step-by-step reasoning and decomposition. We apply TPT across\ndiverse training configurations up to 100B tokens, encompassing pre-training\nwith both constrained and abundant data, as well as mid-training from strong\nopen-source checkpoints. Experimental results indicate that our method\nsubstantially improves the performance of LLMs across various model sizes and\nfamilies. Notably, TPT enhances the data efficiency of LLM pre-training by a\nfactor of 3. For a 3B parameter model, it improves the post-training\nperformance by over 10% on several challenging reasoning benchmarks.",

However, these approaches are limited by the quality of human\ndemonstrations, the manual effort required for data collection, and the\ndiminishing returns from increasing offline data. In comparison, reinforcement\nlearning (RL) trains an agent through autonomous interaction with the\nenvironment and has shown remarkable success in various domains.

We present a recipe that combines the benefits of BC and RL\nthrough a residual learning framework.

The HASC builds upon existing model card and system\ncard concepts by integrating a comprehensive, dynamic record of an AI system's\nsecurity and safety posture. The framework proposes a standardized system of\nidentifiers, including a novel AI Safety Hazard (ASH) ID, to complement\nexisting security identifiers like CVEs, allowing for clear and consistent\ncommunication of fixed flaws. By providing a single, accessible source of\ntruth, the HASC empowers developers and stakeholders to make more informed\ndecisions about AI system safety throughout its lifecycle. Ultimately, we also\ncompare our proposed AI system cards with the ISO/IEC 42001:2023 standard and\ndiscuss how they can be used to complement each other, providing greater\ntransparency and accountability for AI systems.",

    "title": "Blueprints of Trust: AI System Cards for End to End Transparency and\n  Governance",
    "summary": "This paper introduces the Hazard-Aware System Card (HASC), a novel framework\ndesigned to enhance transparency and accountability in the development and\ndeployment of AI systems. The HASC builds upon existing model card and system\ncard concepts by integrating a comprehensive, dynamic record of an AI system's\nsecurity and safety posture. The framework proposes a standardized system of\nidentifiers, including a novel AI Safety Hazard (ASH) ID, to complement\nexisting security identifiers like CVEs, allowing for clear and consistent\ncommunication of fixed flaws. By providing a single, accessible source of\ntruth, the HASC empowers developers and stakeholders to make more informed\ndecisions about AI system safety throughout its lifecycle. Ultimately, we also\ncompare our proposed AI system cards with the ISO/IEC 42001:2023 standard and\ndiscuss how they can be used to complement each other, providing greater\ntransparency and accountability for AI systems.",

However, SER in\nreal-world deployments often fails under domain mismatch, where source data are\nunavailable and powerful LALMs are accessible only through an API. We ask:\ngiven only unlabeled target-domain audio and an API-only LALM, can a student\nmodel be adapted to outperform the LALM in the target domain? To this end, we\npropose MI-Fuse, a denoised label fusion framework that supplements the LALM\nwith a source-domain trained SER classifier as an auxiliary teacher. The\nframework draws multiple stochastic predictions from both teachers, weights\ntheir mean distributions by mutual-information-based uncertainty, and\nstabilizes training with an exponential moving average teacher. Experiments\nacross three public emotion datasets and six cross-domain transfers show\nconsistent gains, with the student surpassing the LALM and outperforming the\nstrongest baseline by 3.9%. This approach strengthens emotion-aware speech\nsystems without sharing source data, enabling realistic adaptation.",
