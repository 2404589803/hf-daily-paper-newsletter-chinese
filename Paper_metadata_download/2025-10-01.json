This presents a fundamental challenge for existing methods:\napproaches that optimize for accuracy often amplify hallucinations, while those\nthat encourage abstention can become overly conservative, sacrificing correct\nanswers. Both extremes ultimately compromise truthfulness. In this work, we\npresent TruthRL, a general reinforcement learning (RL) framework that directly\noptimizes the truthfulness of LLMs. Specifically, we implement TruthRL using\nGRPO with a simple yet effective ternary reward that distinguishes correct\nanswers, hallucinations, and abstentions. It incentivizes models to reduce\nhallucinations not only by providing correct responses, but also by enabling\nabstention when uncertain, thereby improving truthfulness.

      "summary": "We introduce OceanGym, the first comprehensive benchmark for ocean underwater\nembodied agents, designed to advance AI in one of the most demanding real-world\nenvironments. Unlike terrestrial or aerial domains, underwater settings present\nextreme perceptual and decision-making challenges, including low visibility,\ndynamic ocean currents, making effective agent deployment exceptionally\ndifficult. OceanGym encompasses eight realistic task domains and a unified\nagent framework driven by Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), which\nintegrates perception, memory, and sequential decision-making. Agents are\nrequired to comprehend optical and sonar data, autonomously explore complex\nenvironments, and accomplish long-horizon objectives under these harsh\nconditions. Extensive experiments reveal substantial gaps between\nstate-of-the-art MLLM-driven agents and human experts, highlighting the\npersistent difficulty of perception, planning, and adaptability in ocean\nunderwater environments. By providing a high-fidelity, rigorously designed\nplatform, OceanGym establishes a testbed for developing robust embodied AI and\ntransferring these capabilities to real-world autonomous ocean underwater\nvehicles, marking a decisive step toward intelligent agents capable of\noperating in one of Earth's last unexplored frontiers. The code and data are\navailable at https://github.com/OceanGPT/OceanGym.",

    "summary": "We introduce OceanGym, the first comprehensive benchmark for ocean underwater\nembodied agents, designed to advance AI in one of the most demanding real-world\nenvironments. Unlike terrestrial or aerial domains, underwater settings present\nextreme perceptual and decision-making challenges, including low visibility,\ndynamic ocean currents, making effective agent deployment exceptionally\ndifficult. OceanGym encompasses eight realistic task domains and a unified\nagent framework driven by Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), which\nintegrates perception, memory, and sequential decision-making. Agents are\nrequired to comprehend optical and sonar data, autonomously explore complex\nenvironments, and accomplish long-horizon objectives under these harsh\nconditions. Extensive experiments reveal substantial gaps between\nstate-of-the-art MLLM-driven agents and human experts, highlighting the\npersistent difficulty of perception, planning, and adaptability in ocean\nunderwater environments. By providing a high-fidelity, rigorously designed\nplatform, OceanGym establishes a testbed for developing robust embodied AI and\ntransferring these capabilities to real-world autonomous ocean underwater\nvehicles, marking a decisive step toward intelligent agents capable of\noperating in one of Earth's last unexplored frontiers. The code and data are\navailable at https://github.com/OceanGPT/OceanGym.",

Instead, turning off explicit reasoning triggers a broader-but less\nefficient-set of compensatory heads. Through ablation and qualitative analyses,\nwe connect these circuit-level dynamics to a crucial performance trade-off:\nstrengthened heads enable sophisticated problem-solving strategies for\ndifficult problems but can also introduce over-thinking failure modes, such as\ncalculation errors or logical loops on simpler tasks. These findings connect\ncircuit-level dynamics to macro-level performance, identifying an inherent\ntension where complex reasoning comes at the cost of elementary computations.\nMore broadly, our work points to future directions for training policy design,\nemphasizing the need to balance the development of effective reasoning\nstrategies with the assurance of reliable, flawless execution.",

These priors allow latent visual\ncapabilities to be unlocked for vision tasks with a relatively small amount of\nmultimodal data, and in some cases, to perform visual tasks without ever having\nseen an image. Through systematic analysis, we reveal that visual priors-the\nimplicit, emergent knowledge about the visual world acquired during language\npre-training-are composed of separable perception and reasoning priors with\nunique scaling trends and origins. We show that an LLM's latent visual\nreasoning ability is predominantly developed by pre-training on\nreasoning-centric data (e.g., code, math, academia) and scales progressively.\nThis reasoning prior acquired from language pre-training is transferable and\nuniversally applicable to visual reasoning. In contrast, a perception prior\nemerges more diffusely from broad corpora, and perception ability is more\nsensitive to the vision encoder and visual instruction tuning data. In\nparallel, text describing the visual world proves crucial, though its\nperformance impact saturates rapidly. Leveraging these insights, we propose a\ndata-centric recipe for pre-training vision-aware LLMs and verify it in 1T\ntoken scale pre-training. Our findings are grounded in over 100 controlled\nexperiments consuming 500,000 GPU-hours, spanning the full MLLM construction\npipeline-from LLM pre-training to visual alignment and supervised multimodal\nfine-tuning-across five model scales, a wide range of data categories and\nmixtures, and multiple adaptation setups.

This difficulty arises from the complexity of accurately modeling\nmotion, which involves capturing physical constraints, object interactions, and\ndomain-specific dynamics that are not easily generalized across diverse\nscenarios. To address this, we propose MotionRAG, a retrieval-augmented\nframework that enhances motion realism by adapting motion priors from relevant\nreference videos through Context-Aware Motion Adaptation (CAMA). The key\ntechnical innovations include: (i) a retrieval-based pipeline extracting\nhigh-level motion features using video encoder and specialized resamplers to\ndistill semantic motion representations; (ii) an in-context learning approach\nfor motion adaptation implemented through a causal transformer architecture;\n(iii) an attention-based motion injection adapter that seamlessly integrates\ntransferred motion features into pretrained video diffusion models. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that our method achieves significant improvements\nacross multiple domains and various base models, all with negligible\ncomputational overhead during inference. Furthermore, our modular design\nenables zero-shot generalization to new domains by simply updating the\nretrieval database without retraining any components. This research enhances\nthe core capability of video generation systems by enabling the effective\nretrieval and transfer of motion priors, facilitating the synthesis of\nrealistic motion dynamics.",

    "summary": "Image-to-video generation has made remarkable progress with the advancements\nin diffusion models, yet generating videos with realistic motion remains highly\nchallenging. This difficulty arises from the complexity of accurately modeling\nmotion, which involves capturing physical constraints, object interactions, and\ndomain-specific dynamics that are not easily generalized across diverse\nscenarios. To address this, we propose MotionRAG, a retrieval-augmented\nframework that enhances motion realism by adapting motion priors from relevant\nreference videos through Context-Aware Motion Adaptation (CAMA). The key\ntechnical innovations include: (i) a retrieval-based pipeline extracting\nhigh-level motion features using video encoder and specialized resamplers to\ndistill semantic motion representations; (ii) an in-context learning approach\nfor motion adaptation implemented through a causal transformer architecture;\n(iii) an attention-based motion injection adapter that seamlessly integrates\ntransferred motion features into pretrained video diffusion models. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that our method achieves significant improvements\nacross multiple domains and various base models, all with negligible\ncomputational overhead during inference. Furthermore, our modular design\nenables zero-shot generalization to new domains by simply updating the\nretrieval database without retraining any components. This research enhances\nthe core capability of video generation systems by enabling the effective\nretrieval and transfer of motion priors, facilitating the synthesis of\nrealistic motion dynamics.",

Drawing on prospect theory from behavioral\neconomics, we propose a human-centric explanation. We prove that online\non-policy sampling better approximates the human-perceived distribution of what\nthe model can produce, and PPO/GRPO-style clipping -- originally introduced to\njust stabilize training -- recovers a perceptual bias in how humans perceive\nprobability. In this sense, PPO/GRPO act as perceptual losses already. Our\ntheory further suggests that the online/offline dichotomy is itself incidental\nto maximizing human utility, since we can achieve the same effect by\nselectively training on any data in a manner that mimics human perception,\nrather than restricting ourselves to online on-policy data. Doing so would\nallow us to post-train more quickly, cheaply, and flexibly without sacrificing\nperformance. To this end, we propose a design pattern that explicitly\nincorporates perceptual distortions of probability into objectives like\nDPO/KTO/GRPO, creating humanline variants of them. Surprisingly, we find that\nthese humanline variants, even when trained with offline off-policy data, can\nmatch the performance of their online counterparts on both verifiable and\nunverifiable tasks.",

To address this limitation, we first propose a new paradigm:\nTest-Time Policy Adaptation for Multi-Turn Interactions (T2PAM), which utilizes\nuser feedback from the ongoing interaction as a reward signal to estimate a\nlatent optimal policy aligned with user preferences, then updates a small\nsubset of parameters to steer the model toward this policy, ultimately enabling\nefficient in-conversation self-correction. We then introduce Optimum-Referenced\nOne-Step Adaptation (ROSA), a lightweight algorithm that operationalizes T2PAM.\nROSA guides the model parameters toward a theoretical optimal policy in a\nsingle, efficient update step, avoiding costly iterative gradient-based\noptimization and minimizing computational overhead.

This gap raises a critical question: can current models generalize to\nlocalized, non-semantic audio that communities instantly recognize but\noutsiders do not? To address this, we present TAU (Taiwan Audio Understanding),\na benchmark of everyday Taiwanese \"soundmarks.\" TAU is built through a pipeline\ncombining curated sources, human editing, and LLM-assisted question generation,\nproducing 702 clips and 1,794 multiple-choice items that cannot be solved by\ntranscripts alone. Experiments show that state-of-the-art LALMs, including\nGemini 2.5 and Qwen2-Audio, perform far below local humans. TAU demonstrates\nthe need for localized benchmarks to reveal cultural blind spots, guide more\nequitable multimodal evaluation, and ensure models serve communities beyond the\nglobal mainstream.",

    "summary": "Large audio-language models are advancing rapidly, yet most evaluations\nemphasize speech or globally sourced sounds, overlooking culturally distinctive\ncues. This gap raises a critical question: can current models generalize to\nlocalized, non-semantic audio that communities instantly recognize but\noutsiders do not? To address this, we present TAU (Taiwan Audio Understanding),\na benchmark of everyday Taiwanese \"soundmarks.\" TAU is built through a pipeline\ncombining curated sources, human editing, and LLM-assisted question generation,\nproducing 702 clips and 1,794 multiple-choice items that cannot be solved by\ntranscripts alone. Experiments show that state-of-the-art LALMs, including\nGemini 2.5 and Qwen2-Audio, perform far below local humans. TAU demonstrates\nthe need for localized benchmarks to reveal cultural blind spots, guide more\nequitable multimodal evaluation, and ensure models serve communities beyond the\nglobal mainstream.",

      "summary": "Adversarial purification with diffusion models has emerged as a promising\ndefense strategy, but existing methods typically rely on uniform noise\ninjection, which indiscriminately perturbs all frequencies, corrupting semantic\nstructures and undermining robustness. Our empirical study reveals that\nadversarial perturbations are not uniformly distributed: they are predominantly\nconcentrated in high-frequency regions, with heterogeneous magnitude intensity\npatterns that vary across frequencies and attack types. Motivated by this\nobservation, we introduce MANI-Pure, a magnitude-adaptive purification\nframework that leverages the magnitude spectrum of inputs to guide the\npurification process. Instead of injecting homogeneous noise, MANI-Pure\nadaptively applies heterogeneous, frequency-targeted noise, effectively\nsuppressing adversarial perturbations in fragile high-frequency, low-magnitude\nbands while preserving semantically critical low-frequency content. Extensive\nexperiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-1K validate the effectiveness of\nMANI-Pure. It narrows the clean accuracy gap to within 0.59 of the original\nclassifier, while boosting robust accuracy by 2.15, and achieves the top-1\nrobust accuracy on the RobustBench leaderboard, surpassing the previous\nstate-of-the-art method.",

    "title": "MANI-Pure: Magnitude-Adaptive Noise Injection for Adversarial\n  Purification",
    "summary": "Adversarial purification with diffusion models has emerged as a promising\ndefense strategy, but existing methods typically rely on uniform noise\ninjection, which indiscriminately perturbs all frequencies, corrupting semantic\nstructures and undermining robustness. Our empirical study reveals that\nadversarial perturbations are not uniformly distributed: they are predominantly\nconcentrated in high-frequency regions, with heterogeneous magnitude intensity\npatterns that vary across frequencies and attack types. Motivated by this\nobservation, we introduce MANI-Pure, a magnitude-adaptive purification\nframework that leverages the magnitude spectrum of inputs to guide the\npurification process. Instead of injecting homogeneous noise, MANI-Pure\nadaptively applies heterogeneous, frequency-targeted noise, effectively\nsuppressing adversarial perturbations in fragile high-frequency, low-magnitude\nbands while preserving semantically critical low-frequency content. Extensive\nexperiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-1K validate the effectiveness of\nMANI-Pure. It narrows the clean accuracy gap to within 0.59 of the original\nclassifier, while boosting robust accuracy by 2.15, and achieves the top-1\nrobust accuracy on the RobustBench leaderboard, surpassing the previous\nstate-of-the-art method.",
