      "summary": "Designing solutions for complex engineering challenges is crucial in human\nproduction activities. However, previous research in the retrieval-augmented\ngeneration (RAG) field has not sufficiently addressed tasks related to the\ndesign of complex engineering solutions. To fill this gap, we introduce a new\nbenchmark, SolutionBench, to evaluate a system's ability to generate complete\nand feasible solutions for engineering problems with multiple complex\nconstraints. To further advance the design of complex engineering solutions, we\npropose a novel system, SolutionRAG, that leverages the tree-based exploration\nand bi-point thinking mechanism to generate reliable solutions. Extensive\nexperimental results demonstrate that SolutionRAG achieves state-of-the-art\n(SOTA) performance on the SolutionBench, highlighting its potential to enhance\nthe automation and reliability of complex engineering solution design in\nreal-world applications.",

      "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in\nsolving complex reasoning tasks through mechanisms like Chain-of-Thought (CoT)\nprompting, which emphasizes verbose, step-by-step reasoning. However, humans\ntypically employ a more efficient strategy: drafting concise intermediate\nthoughts that capture only essential information. In this work, we propose\nChain of Draft (CoD), a novel paradigm inspired by human cognitive processes,\nwhere LLMs generate minimalistic yet informative intermediate reasoning outputs\nwhile solving tasks. By reducing verbosity and focusing on critical insights,\nCoD matches or surpasses CoT in accuracy while using as little as only 7.6% of\nthe tokens, significantly reducing cost and latency across various reasoning\ntasks.",

      "summary": "Understanding information from visually rich documents remains a significant\nchallenge for traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods.\nExisting benchmarks predominantly focus on image-based question answering (QA),\noverlooking the fundamental challenges of efficient retrieval, comprehension,\nand reasoning within dense visual documents. To bridge this gap, we introduce\nViDoSeek, a novel dataset designed to evaluate RAG performance on visually rich\ndocuments requiring complex reasoning. Based on it, we identify key limitations\nin current RAG approaches: (i) purely visual retrieval methods struggle to\neffectively integrate both textual and visual features, and (ii) previous\napproaches often allocate insufficient reasoning tokens, limiting their\neffectiveness. To address these challenges, we propose ViDoRAG, a novel\nmulti-agent RAG framework tailored for complex reasoning across visual\ndocuments. ViDoRAG employs a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)-based hybrid strategy\nto effectively handle multi-modal retrieval. To further elicit the model's\nreasoning capabilities, we introduce an iterative agent workflow incorporating\nexploration, summarization, and reflection, providing a framework for\ninvestigating test-time scaling in RAG domains. Extensive experiments on\nViDoSeek validate the effectiveness and generalization of our approach.\nNotably, ViDoRAG outperforms existing methods by over 10% on the competitive\nViDoSeek benchmark.",

In this work, we investigate a fundamental\nyet computationally intractable problem: determining whether a given\nmultivariate polynomial is nonnegative. This problem, closely related to\nHilbert's Seventeenth Problem, plays a crucial role in global polynomial\noptimization and has applications in various fields. First, we introduce\nSoS-1K, a meticulously curated dataset of approximately 1,000 polynomials,\nalong with expert-designed reasoning instructions based on five progressively\nchallenging criteria. Evaluating multiple state-of-the-art LLMs, we find that\nwithout structured guidance, all models perform only slightly above the random\nguess baseline 50%. However, high-quality reasoning instructions significantly\nimprove accuracy, boosting performance up to 81%. Furthermore, our 7B model,\nSoS-7B, fine-tuned on SoS-1K for just 4 hours, outperforms the 671B DeepSeek-V3\nand GPT-4o-mini in accuracy while only requiring 1.8% and 5% of the computation\ntime needed for letters, respectively.

      "summary": "Recent Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made great progress in\nvideo understanding. However, their performance on videos involving human\nactions is still limited by the lack of high-quality data. To address this, we\nintroduce a two-stage data annotation pipeline. First, we design strategies to\naccumulate videos featuring clear human actions from the Internet. Second,\nvideos are annotated in a standardized caption format that uses human\nattributes to distinguish individuals and chronologically details their actions\nand interactions. Through this pipeline, we curate two datasets, namely\nHAICTrain and HAICBench. HAICTrain comprises 126K video-caption pairs\ngenerated by Gemini-Pro and verified for training purposes. Meanwhile,\nHAICBench includes 500 manually annotated video-caption pairs and\n1,400 QA pairs, for a comprehensive evaluation of human action understanding.\nExperimental results demonstrate that training with HAICTrain not only\nsignificantly enhances human understanding abilities across 4 benchmarks, but\ncan also improve text-to-video generation results. Both the HAICTrain and\nHAICBench are released at https://huggingface.co/datasets/KuaishouHAIC/HAIC.",

      "title": "LiteASR: Efficient Automatic Speech Recognition with Low-Rank\n  Approximation",
      "summary": "Modern automatic speech recognition (ASR) models, such as OpenAI's Whisper,\nrely on deep encoder-decoder architectures, and their encoders are a critical\nbottleneck for efficient deployment due to high computational intensity. We\nintroduce LiteASR, a low-rank compression scheme for ASR encoders that\nsignificantly reduces inference costs while maintaining transcription accuracy.\nOur approach leverages the strong low-rank properties observed in intermediate\nactivations: by applying principal component analysis (PCA) with a small\ncalibration dataset, we approximate linear transformations with a chain of\nlow-rank matrix multiplications, and further optimize self-attention to work in\nthe reduced dimension. Evaluation results show that our method can compress\nWhisper large-v3's encoder size by over 50%, matching Whisper medium's size\nwith better transcription accuracy, thereby establishing a new Pareto-optimal\nfrontier of efficiency and performance. The code of LiteASR is available at\nhttps://github.com/efeslab/LiteASR.",
