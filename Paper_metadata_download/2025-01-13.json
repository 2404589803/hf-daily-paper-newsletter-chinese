      "title": "VideoRAG: Retrieval-Augmented Generation over Video Corpus",
      "summary": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a powerful strategy to address the\nissue of generating factually incorrect outputs in foundation models by\nretrieving external knowledge relevant to queries and incorporating it into\ntheir generation process. However, existing RAG approaches have primarily\nfocused on textual information, with some recent advancements beginning to\nconsider images, and they largely overlook videos, a rich source of multimodal\nknowledge capable of representing events, processes, and contextual details\nmore effectively than any other modality. While a few recent studies explore\nthe integration of videos in the response generation process, they either\npredefine query-associated videos without retrieving them according to queries,\nor convert videos into the textual descriptions without harnessing their\nmultimodal richness. To tackle these, we introduce VideoRAG, a novel framework\nthat not only dynamically retrieves relevant videos based on their relevance\nwith queries but also utilizes both visual and textual information of videos in\nthe output generation. Further, to operationalize this, our method revolves\naround the recent advance of Large Video Language Models (LVLMs), which enable\nthe direct processing of video content to represent it for retrieval and\nseamless integration of the retrieved videos jointly with queries. We\nexperimentally validate the effectiveness of VideoRAG, showcasing that it is\nsuperior to relevant baselines.",

      "summary": "Despite their remarkable performance, the development of Large Language\nModels (LLMs) faces a critical challenge in scalable oversight: providing\neffective feedback for tasks where human evaluation is difficult or where LLMs\noutperform humans. While there is growing interest in using LLMs for critique,\ncurrent approaches still rely on human annotations or more powerful models,\nleaving the issue of enhancing critique capabilities without external\nsupervision unresolved. We introduce SCRIT (Self-evolving CRITic), a framework\nthat enables genuine self-evolution of critique abilities. Technically, SCRIT\nself-improves by training on synthetic data, generated by a contrastive-based\nself-critic that uses reference solutions for step-by-step critique, and a\nself-validation mechanism that ensures critique quality through correction\noutcomes. Implemented with Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct, one of the most powerful LLMs,\nSCRIT achieves up to a 10.3\\% improvement on critique-correction and error\nidentification benchmarks. Our analysis reveals that SCRIT's performance scales\npositively with data and model size, outperforms alternative approaches, and\nbenefits critically from its self-validation component.",

      "title": "OmniManip: Towards General Robotic Manipulation via Object-Centric\n  Interaction Primitives as Spatial Constraints",
      "summary": "The development of general robotic systems capable of manipulating in\nunstructured environments is a significant challenge. While Vision-Language\nModels(VLM) excel in high-level commonsense reasoning, they lack the\nfine-grained 3D spatial understanding required for precise manipulation tasks.\nFine-tuning VLM on robotic datasets to create Vision-Language-Action\nModels(VLA) is a potential solution, but it is hindered by high data collection\ncosts and generalization issues. To address these challenges, we propose a\nnovel object-centric representation that bridges the gap between VLM's\nhigh-level reasoning and the low-level precision required for manipulation. Our\nkey insight is that an object's canonical space, defined by its functional\naffordances, provides a structured and semantically meaningful way to describe\ninteraction primitives, such as points and directions. These primitives act as\na bridge, translating VLM's commonsense reasoning into actionable 3D spatial\nconstraints. In this context, we introduce a dual closed-loop, open-vocabulary\nrobotic manipulation system: one loop for high-level planning through primitive\nresampling, interaction rendering and VLM checking, and another for low-level\nexecution via 6D pose tracking. This design ensures robust, real-time control\nwithout requiring VLM fine-tuning. Extensive experiments demonstrate strong\nzero-shot generalization across diverse robotic manipulation tasks,\nhighlighting the potential of this approach for automating large-scale\nsimulation data generation.",

      "summary": "Reasoning is a fundamental capability for solving complex multi-step\nproblems, particularly in visual contexts where sequential step-wise\nunderstanding is essential. Existing approaches lack a comprehensive framework\nfor evaluating visual reasoning and do not emphasize step-wise problem-solving.\nTo this end, we propose a comprehensive framework for advancing step-by-step\nvisual reasoning in large language models (LMMs) through three key\ncontributions. First, we introduce a visual reasoning benchmark specifically\ndesigned to evaluate multi-step reasoning tasks. The benchmark presents a\ndiverse set of challenges with eight different categories ranging from complex\nvisual perception to scientific reasoning with over 4k reasoning steps in\ntotal, enabling robust evaluation of LLMs' abilities to perform accurate and\ninterpretable visual reasoning across multiple steps. Second, we propose a\nnovel metric that assesses visual reasoning quality at the granularity of\nindividual steps, emphasizing both correctness and logical coherence. The\nproposed metric offers deeper insights into reasoning performance compared to\ntraditional end-task accuracy metrics. Third, we present a new multimodal\nvisual reasoning model, named LlamaV-o1, trained using a multi-step curriculum\nlearning approach, where tasks are progressively organized to facilitate\nincremental skill acquisition and problem-solving. The proposed LlamaV-o1 is\ndesigned for multi-step reasoning and learns step-by-step through a structured\ntraining paradigm. Extensive experiments show that our LlamaV-o1 outperforms\nexisting open-source models and performs favorably against close-source\nproprietary models. Compared to the recent Llava-CoT, our LlamaV-o1 achieves an\naverage score of 67.3 with an absolute gain of 3.8\\% across six benchmarks\nwhile being 5 times faster during inference scaling. Our benchmark, model, and\ncode are publicly available.",

To improve\nmodels beyond the training data, recent works have explored how LLMs can be\nused to generate synthetic data for autonomous self-improvement. However,\nsuccessive steps of self-improvement can reach a point of diminishing returns.\nIn this work, we propose a complementary approach towards self-improvement\nwhere finetuning is applied to a multiagent society of language models. A group\nof language models, all starting from the same base model, are independently\nspecialized by updating each one using data generated through multiagent\ninteractions among the models. By training each model on independent sets of\ndata, we illustrate how this approach enables specialization across models and\ndiversification over the set of models. As a result, our overall system is able\nto preserve diverse reasoning chains and autonomously improve over many more\nrounds of fine-tuning than single-agent self-improvement methods. We\nquantitatively illustrate the efficacy of the approach across a wide suite of\nreasoning tasks.",
