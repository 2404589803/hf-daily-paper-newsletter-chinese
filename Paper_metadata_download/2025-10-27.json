Existing agent frameworks typically follow predefined workflows,\nwhich limit autonomous and global task completion. In this paper, we introduce\nDeepAgent, an end-to-end deep reasoning agent that performs autonomous\nthinking, tool discovery, and action execution within a single, coherent\nreasoning process. To address the challenges of long-horizon interactions,\nparticularly the context length explosion from multiple tool calls and the\naccumulation of interaction history, we introduce an autonomous memory folding\nmechanism that compresses past interactions into structured episodic, working,\nand tool memories, reducing error accumulation while preserving critical\ninformation. To teach general-purpose tool use efficiently and stably, we\ndevelop an end-to-end reinforcement learning strategy, namely ToolPO, that\nleverages LLM-simulated APIs and applies tool-call advantage attribution to\nassign fine-grained credit to the tool invocation tokens. Extensive experiments\non eight benchmarks, including general tool-use tasks (ToolBench, API-Bank,\nTMDB, Spotify, ToolHop) and downstream applications (ALFWorld, WebShop, GAIA,\nHLE), demonstrate that DeepAgent consistently outperforms baselines across both\nlabeled-tool and open-set tool retrieval scenarios.

Existing methods either introduce artifacts by\nenforcing inappropriate pixel-wise priors from structure-based controls, or\nrely on non-generalizable, condition-specific finetuning or task-specific\narchitectures. We introduce Video-As-Prompt (VAP), a new paradigm that reframes\nthis problem as in-context generation. VAP leverages a reference video as a\ndirect semantic prompt, guiding a frozen Video Diffusion Transformer (DiT) via\na plug-and-play Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT) expert. This architecture\nprevents catastrophic forgetting and is guided by a temporally biased position\nembedding that eliminates spurious mapping priors for robust context retrieval.\nTo power this approach and catalyze future research, we built VAP-Data, the\nlargest dataset for semantic-controlled video generation with over 100K paired\nvideos across 100 semantic conditions. As a single unified model, VAP sets a\nnew state-of-the-art for open-source methods, achieving a 38.7% user preference\nrate that rivals leading condition-specific commercial models.

      "summary": "Scaling the context length of large language models (LLMs) offers significant\nbenefits but is computationally expensive. This expense stems primarily from\nthe self-attention mechanism, whose O(N^2) complexity with respect to\nsequence length presents a major bottleneck for both memory and latency.\nFortunately, the attention matrix is often sparse, particularly for long\nsequences, suggesting an opportunity for optimization. Block-sparse attention\nhas emerged as a promising solution that partitions sequences into blocks and\nskips computation for a subset of these blocks. However, the effectiveness of\nthis method is highly dependent on the underlying attention patterns, which can\nlead to sub-optimal block-level sparsity. For instance, important key tokens\nfor queries within a single block may be scattered across numerous other\nblocks, leading to computational redundancy. In this work, we propose Permuted\nBlock-Sparse Attention (PBS-Attn), a plug-and-play method that\nleverages the permutation properties of attention to increase block-level\nsparsity and enhance the computational efficiency of LLM prefilling. We conduct\ncomprehensive experiments on challenging real-world long-context datasets,\ndemonstrating that PBS-Attn consistently outperforms existing block-sparse\nattention methods in model accuracy and closely matches the full attention\nbaseline. Powered by our custom permuted-FlashAttention kernels, PBS-Attn\nachieves an end-to-end speedup of up to 2.75times in long-context\nprefilling, confirming its practical viability.

    "summary": "Scaling the context length of large language models (LLMs) offers significant\nbenefits but is computationally expensive. This expense stems primarily from\nthe self-attention mechanism, whose O(N^2) complexity with respect to\nsequence length presents a major bottleneck for both memory and latency.\nFortunately, the attention matrix is often sparse, particularly for long\nsequences, suggesting an opportunity for optimization. Block-sparse attention\nhas emerged as a promising solution that partitions sequences into blocks and\nskips computation for a subset of these blocks. However, the effectiveness of\nthis method is highly dependent on the underlying attention patterns, which can\nlead to sub-optimal block-level sparsity. For instance, important key tokens\nfor queries within a single block may be scattered across numerous other\nblocks, leading to computational redundancy. In this work, we propose Permuted\nBlock-Sparse Attention (PBS-Attn), a plug-and-play method that\nleverages the permutation properties of attention to increase block-level\nsparsity and enhance the computational efficiency of LLM prefilling. We conduct\ncomprehensive experiments on challenging real-world long-context datasets,\ndemonstrating that PBS-Attn consistently outperforms existing block-sparse\nattention methods in model accuracy and closely matches the full attention\nbaseline. Powered by our custom permuted-FlashAttention kernels, PBS-Attn\nachieves an end-to-end speedup of up to 2.75times in long-context\nprefilling, confirming its practical viability.

Finally, using these\ndemonstrations, we train a lightweight GNN-based world model that is embedded\nwith physical properties. The real video can be used to further refine the\nphysical properties. PhysWorld achieves accurate and fast future predictions\nfor various deformable objects, and also generalizes well to novel\ninteractions. Experiments show that PhysWorld has competitive performance while\nenabling inference speeds 47 times faster than the recent state-of-the-art\nmethod, i.e., PhysTwin.",

Humans, in contrast, actively explore and\ninteract with their environment-moving, examining, and manipulating objects-to\ngather information through a closed-loop process integrating perception,\nreasoning, and action. Inspired by this human capability, we introduce the\nActive Visual Reasoning (AVR) task, extending visual reasoning to partially\nobservable, interactive environments.
