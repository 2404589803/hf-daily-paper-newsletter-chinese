Unlike\nprior methods that require dense posed images or pose-embedded generative\nmodels limited to in-domain views, our method leverages off-the-shelf geometry\npredictors to predict partial geometries viewed from reference images, and\nformulates novel-view synthesis as an inpainting task for both image and\ngeometry. To ensure accurate alignment between generated images and geometry,\nwe propose cross-modal attention distillation, where attention maps from the\nimage diffusion branch are injected into a parallel geometry diffusion branch\nduring both training and inference. This multi-task approach achieves\nsynergistic effects, facilitating geometrically robust image synthesis as well\nas well-defined geometry prediction. We further introduce proximity-based mesh\nconditioning to integrate depth and normal cues, interpolating between point\ncloud and filtering erroneously predicted geometry from influencing the\ngeneration process. Empirically, our method achieves high-fidelity\nextrapolative view synthesis on both image and geometry across a range of\nunseen scenes, delivers competitive reconstruction quality under interpolation\nsettings, and produces geometrically aligned colored point clouds for\ncomprehensive 3D completion.

Building on these textual descriptions, we\nfurther incorporate targeted, interpretable human-crafted guidelines to guide\nmodels' reasoning under zero-shot CoT prompting. As such, this framework allows\nfor easy adaptation to different harmfulness detection criteria across\nplatforms, regions, and over time, offering high flexibility and\nexplainability. Extensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets validate the\neffectiveness of our framework, highlighting its potential for explainable and\nlow-resource harmful meme detection using small-scale LLMs. Codes and data are\navailable at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/HMC-AF2B/README.md.",
