To answer this, we\nintroduce PICABench, which systematically evaluates physical realism across\neight sub-dimension (spanning optics, mechanics, and state transitions) for\nmost of the common editing operations (add, remove, attribute change, etc). We\nfurther propose the PICAEval, a reliable evaluation protocol that uses\nVLM-as-a-judge with per-case, region-level human annotations and questions.\nBeyond benchmarking, we also explore effective solutions by learning physics\nfrom videos and construct a training dataset PICA-100K. After evaluating most\nof the mainstream models, we observe that physical realism remains a\nchallenging problem with large rooms to explore.

However, existing RAG systems primarily focus on unimodal text\ndocuments, and often fall short in real-world scenarios where both queries and\ndocuments may contain mixed modalities (such as text and images). In this\npaper, we address the challenge of Universal Retrieval-Augmented Generation\n(URAG), which involves retrieving and reasoning over mixed-modal information to\nimprove vision-language generation. To this end, we propose Nyx, a unified\nmixed-modal to mixed-modal retriever tailored for URAG scenarios. To mitigate\nthe scarcity of realistic mixed-modal data, we introduce a four-stage automated\npipeline for generation and filtering, leveraging web documents to construct\nNyxQA, a dataset comprising diverse mixed-modal question-answer pairs that\nbetter reflect real-world information needs. Building on this high-quality\ndataset, we adopt a two-stage training framework for Nyx: we first perform\npre-training on NyxQA along with a variety of open-source retrieval datasets,\nfollowed by supervised fine-tuning using feedback from downstream\nvision-language models (VLMs) to align retrieval outputs with generative\npreferences. Experimental results demonstrate that Nyx not only performs\ncompetitively on standard text-only RAG benchmarks, but also excels in the more\ngeneral and realistic URAG setting, significantly improving generation quality\nin vision-language tasks.",

      "summary": "Recent advances in training-free attention control methods have enabled\nflexible and efficient text-guided editing capabilities for existing generation\nmodels. However, current approaches struggle to simultaneously deliver strong\nediting strength while preserving consistency with the source. This limitation\nbecomes particularly critical in multi-round and video editing, where visual\nerrors can accumulate over time. Moreover, most existing methods enforce global\nconsistency, which limits their ability to modify individual attributes such as\ntexture while preserving others, thereby hindering fine-grained editing.\nRecently, the architectural shift from U-Net to MM-DiT has brought significant\nimprovements in generative performance and introduced a novel mechanism for\nintegrating text and vision modalities. These advancements pave the way for\novercoming challenges that previous methods failed to resolve.

    "summary": "Recent advances in training-free attention control methods have enabled\nflexible and efficient text-guided editing capabilities for existing generation\nmodels. However, current approaches struggle to simultaneously deliver strong\nediting strength while preserving consistency with the source. This limitation\nbecomes particularly critical in multi-round and video editing, where visual\nerrors can accumulate over time. Moreover, most existing methods enforce global\nconsistency, which limits their ability to modify individual attributes such as\ntexture while preserving others, thereby hindering fine-grained editing.\nRecently, the architectural shift from U-Net to MM-DiT has brought significant\nimprovements in generative performance and introduced a novel mechanism for\nintegrating text and vision modalities. These advancements pave the way for\novercoming challenges that previous methods failed to resolve. Through an\nin-depth analysis of MM-DiT, we identify three key insights into its attention\nmechanisms. Building on these, we propose ConsistEdit, a novel attention\ncontrol method specifically tailored for MM-DiT.

      "summary": "The rapid evolution of agentic AI marks a new phase in artificial\nintelligence, where Large Language Models (LLMs) no longer merely respond but\nact, reason, and adapt. This survey traces the paradigm shift in building\nagentic AI: from Pipeline-based systems, where planning, tool use, and memory\nare orchestrated by external logic, to the emerging Model-native paradigm,\nwhere these capabilities are internalized within the model's parameters. We\nfirst position Reinforcement Learning (RL) as the algorithmic engine enabling\nthis paradigm shift. By reframing learning from imitating static data to\noutcome-driven exploration, RL underpins a unified solution of LLM + RL + Task\nacross language, vision and embodied domains. Building on this, the survey\nsystematically reviews how each capability -- Planning, Tool use, and Memory --\nhas evolved from externally scripted modules to end-to-end learned behaviors.\nFurthermore, it examines how this paradigm shift has reshaped major agent\napplications, specifically the Deep Research agent emphasizing long-horizon\nreasoning and the GUI agent emphasizing embodied interaction. We conclude by\ndiscussing the continued internalization of agentic capabilities like\nMulti-agent collaboration and Reflection, alongside the evolving roles of the\nsystem and model layers in future agentic AI. Together, these developments\noutline a coherent trajectory toward model-native agentic AI as an integrated\nlearning and interaction framework, marking the transition from constructing\nsystems that apply intelligence to developing models that grow intelligence\nthrough experience.",

    "summary": "The rapid evolution of agentic AI marks a new phase in artificial\nintelligence, where Large Language Models (LLMs) no longer merely respond but\nact, reason, and adapt. This survey traces the paradigm shift in building\nagentic AI: from Pipeline-based systems, where planning, tool use, and memory\nare orchestrated by external logic, to the emerging Model-native paradigm,\nwhere these capabilities are internalized within the model's parameters. We\nfirst position Reinforcement Learning (RL) as the algorithmic engine enabling\nthis paradigm shift. By reframing learning from imitating static data to\noutcome-driven exploration, RL underpins a unified solution of LLM + RL + Task\nacross language, vision and embodied domains. Building on this, the survey\nsystematically reviews how each capability -- Planning, Tool use, and Memory --\nhas evolved from externally scripted modules to end-to-end learned behaviors.\nFurthermore, it examines how this paradigm shift has reshaped major agent\napplications, specifically the Deep Research agent emphasizing long-horizon\nreasoning and the GUI agent emphasizing embodied interaction. We conclude by\ndiscussing the continued internalization of agentic capabilities like\nMulti-agent collaboration and Reflection, alongside the evolving roles of the\nsystem and model layers in future agentic AI. Together, these developments\noutline a coherent trajectory toward model-native agentic AI as an integrated\nlearning and interaction framework, marking the transition from constructing\nsystems that apply intelligence to developing models that grow intelligence\nthrough experience.",

We\npresent UltraCUA, a foundation model that bridges this gap through hybrid\naction -- seamlessly integrating GUI primitives with high-level programmatic\ntool calls. To achieve this, our approach comprises four key components: (1) an\nautomated pipeline that scales programmatic tools from software documentation,\nopen-source repositories, and code generation; (2) a synthetic data engine\nproducing over 17,000 verifiable tasks spanning real-world computer-use\nscenarios; (3) a large-scale high-quality hybrid action trajectory collection\nwith both low-level GUI actions and high-level programmatic tool calls; and (4)\na two-stage training pipeline combining supervised fine-tuning with online\nreinforcement learning, enabling strategic alternation between low-level and\nhigh-level actions. Experiments with our 7B and 32B models demonstrate\nsubstantial improvements over state-of-the-art agents. On OSWorld, UltraCUA\nmodels achieve an average 22% relative improvement over base models, while\nbeing 11% faster in terms of steps. Out-of-domain evaluation on\nWindowsAgentArena shows our model reaches 21.7% success rate, outperforming\nbaselines trained on Windows data.

To mitigate these risks, we propose a training-based defense that\ncombines Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) on\nsynthetic adversarial data, improving robustness by over 50 points on\nchallenging distractor attacks.

      "summary": "Knowledge-based visual question answering (KB-VQA) requires visual language\nmodels (VLMs) to integrate visual understanding with external knowledge\nretrieval. Although retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) achieves significant\nadvances in this task by combining knowledge-base querying, it still struggles\nwith the quality of multimodal queries and the relevance of retrieved results.\nTo overcome these challenges, we propose a novel three-stage method, termed\nWiki-PRF, including Processing, Retrieval and Filtering stages. The processing\nstage dynamically invokes visual tools to extract precise multimodal\ninformation for retrieval. The retrieval stage integrates visual and text\nfeatures to achieve multimodal knowledge retrieval. The filtering stage\nperforms relevance filtering and concentration on retrieval results. To this\nend, we introduce a visual language model trained with answer accuracy and\nformat consistency as reward signals via a reinforcement learning manner. This\nenhances the model's reasoning, tool invocation for accurate queries, and\nfiltering of irrelevant content. Experiments on benchmark datasets (E-VQA and\nInfoSeek) show significant improvements~(36.0 and 42.8) in answer quality,\nachieving state-of-the-art performance. Code is available at\nhttps://github.com/cqu-student/Wiki-PRF",

    "title": "Knowledge-based Visual Question Answer with Multimodal Processing,\n  Retrieval and Filtering",
    "summary": "Knowledge-based visual question answering (KB-VQA) requires visual language\nmodels (VLMs) to integrate visual understanding with external knowledge\nretrieval. Although retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) achieves significant\nadvances in this task by combining knowledge-base querying, it still struggles\nwith the quality of multimodal queries and the relevance of retrieved results.\nTo overcome these challenges, we propose a novel three-stage method, termed\nWiki-PRF, including Processing, Retrieval and Filtering stages. The processing\nstage dynamically invokes visual tools to extract precise multimodal\ninformation for retrieval. The retrieval stage integrates visual and text\nfeatures to achieve multimodal knowledge retrieval. The filtering stage\nperforms relevance filtering and concentration on retrieval results. To this\nend, we introduce a visual language model trained with answer accuracy and\nformat consistency as reward signals via a reinforcement learning manner. This\nenhances the model's reasoning, tool invocation for accurate queries, and\nfiltering of irrelevant content. Experiments on benchmark datasets (E-VQA and\nInfoSeek) show significant improvements~(36.0 and 42.8) in answer quality,\nachieving state-of-the-art performance. Code is available at\nhttps://github.com/cqu-student/Wiki-PRF",

This design allows narration and inference to run in parallel,\nempowering users to interrupt, query, and steer the model's reasoning process\nat any time. Objective benchmarks show this approach reduces interaction\nlatency by more than 600x compared to monolithic baselines while ensuring high\nfidelity and competitive task accuracy.
