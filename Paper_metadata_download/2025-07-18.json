Although existing studies have predominantly\nfocused on data-driven approaches for arithmetic operations and symbolic\nmanipulation tasks, these approaches tend to be task-specific with limited\noverall performance. To pursue a more general solution, this paper focuses on a\nbroader case of reasoning problems that are computable, i.e., problems that\nalgorithms can solve, thus can be solved by the Turing Machine. From this\nperspective, this paper proposes Turing MAchine Imitation Learning (TAIL) to\nimprove the length generalization ability of LLMs. TAIL synthesizes\nchain-of-thoughts (CoT) data that imitate the execution process of a Turing\nMachine by computer programs, which linearly expands the reasoning steps into\natomic states to alleviate shortcut learning and explicit memory fetch\nmechanism to reduce the difficulties of dynamic and long-range data access in\nelementary operations. To validate the reliability and universality of TAIL, we\nconstruct a challenging synthetic dataset covering 8 classes of algorithms and\n18 tasks. Without bells and whistles, TAIL significantly improves the length\ngeneralization ability as well as the performance of Qwen2.5-7B on various\ntasks using only synthetic data, surpassing previous methods and DeepSeek-R1.\nThe experimental results reveal that the key concepts in the Turing Machine,\ninstead of the thinking styles, are indispensable for TAIL for length\ngeneralization, through which the model exhibits read-and-write behaviors\nconsistent with the properties of the Turing Machine in their attention layers.\nThis work provides a promising direction for future research in the learning of\nLLM reasoning from synthetic data.",

However, we observe that most real-world\nscenarios do not require such an extensive number of visual tokens. While the\nperformance drops significantly in a small subset of OCR-related tasks, models\nstill perform accurately in most other general VQA tasks with only 1/4\nresolution. Therefore, we propose to dynamically process distinct samples with\ndifferent resolutions, and present a new paradigm for visual token compression,\nnamely, VisionThink. It starts with a downsampled image and smartly decides\nwhether it is sufficient for problem solving. Otherwise, the model could output\na special token to request the higher-resolution image. Compared to existing\nEfficient VLM methods that compress tokens using fixed pruning ratios or\nthresholds, VisionThink autonomously decides whether to compress tokens case by\ncase. As a result, it demonstrates strong fine-grained visual understanding\ncapability on OCR-related tasks, and meanwhile saves substantial visual tokens\non simpler tasks. We adopt reinforcement learning and propose the LLM-as-Judge\nstrategy to successfully apply RL to general VQA tasks. Moreover, we carefully\ndesign a reward function and penalty mechanism to achieve a stable and\nreasonable image resize call ratio. Extensive experiments demonstrate the\nsuperiority, efficiency, and effectiveness of our method. Our code is available\nat https://github.com/dvlab-research/VisionThink.",

To\naddress these challenges, we propose FantasyPortrait, a diffusion transformer\nbased framework capable of generating high-fidelity and emotion-rich animations\nfor both single- and multi-character scenarios.

      "summary": "Video Frame Interpolation (VFI) aims to predict the intermediate frame I_n\n(we use n to denote time in videos to avoid notation overload with the timestep\nt in diffusion models) based on two consecutive neighboring frames I_0 and\nI_1. Recent approaches apply diffusion models (both image-based and\nvideo-based) in this task and achieve strong performance. However, image-based\ndiffusion models are unable to extract temporal information and are relatively\ninefficient compared to non-diffusion methods. Video-based diffusion models can\nextract temporal information, but they are too large in terms of training\nscale, model size, and inference time. To mitigate the above issues, we propose\nTemporal-Aware Latent Brownian Bridge Diffusion for Video Frame Interpolation\n(TLB-VFI), an efficient video-based diffusion model. By extracting rich\ntemporal information from video inputs through our proposed 3D-wavelet gating\nand temporal-aware autoencoder, our method achieves 20% improvement in FID on\nthe most challenging datasets over recent SOTA of image-based diffusion models.\nMeanwhile, due to the existence of rich temporal information, our method\nachieves strong performance while having 3times fewer parameters. Such a\nparameter reduction results in 2.3x speed up. By incorporating optical flow\nguidance, our method requires 9000x less training data and achieves over 20x\nfewer parameters than video-based diffusion models.
