To address these challenges, we\nintroduce WebWeaver, a novel dual-agent framework that emulates the human\nresearch process. The planner operates in a dynamic cycle, iteratively\ninterleaving evidence acquisition with outline optimization to produce a\ncomprehensive, source-grounded outline linking to a memory bank of evidence.\nThe writer then executes a hierarchical retrieval and writing process,\ncomposing the report section by section. By performing targeted retrieval of\nonly the necessary evidence from the memory bank for each part, it effectively\nmitigates long-context issues. Our framework establishes a new state-of-the-art\nacross major OEDR benchmarks, including DeepResearch Bench, DeepConsult, and\nDeepResearchGym. These results validate our human-centric, iterative\nmethodology, demonstrating that adaptive planning and focused synthesis are\ncrucial for producing high-quality, reliable, and well-structured reports.",

Complex queries involving multiple entities, intertwined\nrelationships, and high uncertainty demand extensive search cycles that rapidly\nexhaust context budgets before reaching complete solutions. To overcome this\nchallenge, we introduce ReSum, a novel paradigm that enables indefinite\nexploration through periodic context summarization. ReSum converts growing\ninteraction histories into compact reasoning states, maintaining awareness of\nprior discoveries while bypassing context constraints. For paradigm adaptation,\nwe propose ReSum-GRPO, integrating GRPO with segmented trajectory training and\nadvantage broadcasting to familiarize agents with summary-conditioned\nreasoning. Extensive experiments on web agents of varying scales across three\nbenchmarks demonstrate that ReSum delivers an average absolute improvement of\n4.5\\% over ReAct, with further gains of up to 8.2\\% following ReSum-GRPO\ntraining. Notably, with only 1K training samples, our WebResummer-30B (a\nReSum-GRPO-trained version of WebSailor-30B) achieves 33.3\\% Pass@1 on\nBrowseComp-zh and 18.3\\% on BrowseComp-en, surpassing existing open-source web\nagents.",

We introduce Single-stream Policy Optimization (SPO), which\neliminates these issues by design. SPO replaces per-group baselines with a\npersistent, KL-adaptive value tracker and normalizes advantages globally across\nthe batch, providing a stable, low-variance learning signal for every sample.\nBeing group-free, SPO enables higher throughput and scales effectively in\nlong-horizon or tool-integrated settings where generation times vary.\nFurthermore, the persistent value tracker naturally enables an adaptive\ncurriculum via prioritized sampling.

Across five hard math benchmarks with Qwen3 8B, SPO improves the\naverage maj@32 by +3.4 percentage points (pp) over GRPO, driven by substantial\nabsolute point gains on challenging datasets, including +7.3 pp on BRUMO 25,\n+4.4 pp on AIME 25, +3.3 pp on HMMT 25, and achieves consistent relative gain\nin pass@k across the evaluated k values.

      "summary": "Digitizing pathological images into gigapixel Whole Slide Images (WSIs) has\nopened new avenues for Computational Pathology (CPath). As positive tissue\ncomprises only a small fraction of gigapixel WSIs, existing Multiple Instance\nLearning (MIL) methods typically focus on identifying salient instances via\nattention mechanisms. However, this leads to a bias towards easy-to-classify\ninstances while neglecting challenging ones. Recent studies have shown that\nhard examples are crucial for accurately modeling discriminative boundaries.\nApplying such an idea at the instance level, we elaborate a novel MIL framework\nwith masked hard instance mining (MHIM-MIL), which utilizes a Siamese structure\nwith a consistency constraint to explore the hard instances. Using a\nclass-aware instance probability, MHIM-MIL employs a momentum teacher to mask\nsalient instances and implicitly mine hard instances for training the student\nmodel. To obtain diverse, non-redundant hard instances, we adopt large-scale\nrandom masking while utilizing a global recycle network to mitigate the risk of\nlosing key features. Furthermore, the student updates the teacher using an\nexponential moving average, which identifies new hard instances for subsequent\ntraining iterations and stabilizes optimization. Experimental results on cancer\ndiagnosis, subtyping, survival analysis tasks, and 12 benchmarks demonstrate\nthat MHIM-MIL outperforms the latest methods in both performance and\nefficiency.

    "summary": "Digitizing pathological images into gigapixel Whole Slide Images (WSIs) has\nopened new avenues for Computational Pathology (CPath). As positive tissue\ncomprises only a small fraction of gigapixel WSIs, existing Multiple Instance\nLearning (MIL) methods typically focus on identifying salient instances via\nattention mechanisms. However, this leads to a bias towards easy-to-classify\ninstances while neglecting challenging ones. Recent studies have shown that\nhard examples are crucial for accurately modeling discriminative boundaries.\nApplying such an idea at the instance level, we elaborate a novel MIL framework\nwith masked hard instance mining (MHIM-MIL), which utilizes a Siamese structure\nwith a consistency constraint to explore the hard instances. Using a\nclass-aware instance probability, MHIM-MIL employs a momentum teacher to mask\nsalient instances and implicitly mine hard instances for training the student\nmodel. To obtain diverse, non-redundant hard instances, we adopt large-scale\nrandom masking while utilizing a global recycle network to mitigate the risk of\nlosing key features. Furthermore, the student updates the teacher using an\nexponential moving average, which identifies new hard instances for subsequent\ntraining iterations and stabilizes optimization. Experimental results on cancer\ndiagnosis, subtyping, survival analysis tasks, and 12 benchmarks demonstrate\nthat MHIM-MIL outperforms the latest methods in both performance and\nefficiency.
