In this paper, we\nfocus on the task of Mask-free Video Insertion and aim to resolve three key\nchallenges: data scarcity, subject-scene equilibrium, and insertion\nharmonization. To address the data scarcity, we propose a new data pipeline\nInsertPipe, constructing diverse cross-pair data automatically. Building upon\nour data pipeline, we develop OmniInsert, a novel unified framework for\nmask-free video insertion from both single and multiple subject references.\nSpecifically, to maintain subject-scene equilibrium, we introduce a simple yet\neffective Condition-Specific Feature Injection mechanism to distinctly inject\nmulti-source conditions and propose a novel Progressive Training strategy that\nenables the model to balance feature injection from subjects and source video.\nMeanwhile, we design the Subject-Focused Loss to improve the detailed\nappearance of the subjects. To further enhance insertion harmonization, we\npropose an Insertive Preference Optimization methodology to optimize the model\nby simulating human preferences, and incorporate a Context-Aware Rephraser\nmodule during reference to seamlessly integrate the subject into the original\nscenes. To address the lack of a benchmark for the field, we introduce\nInsertBench, a comprehensive benchmark comprising diverse scenes with\nmeticulously selected subjects. Evaluation on InsertBench indicates OmniInsert\noutperforms state-of-the-art closed-source commercial solutions. The code will\nbe released.",

From a first principle perspective, the\nbreakthroughs of LLMs stem not only from their architectures but also from two\ncomplementary mechanisms: context engineering, which enriches raw input queries\nwith contextual cues to better elicit model capabilities, and multi-step\nreasoning, which iteratively refines model outputs through intermediate\nreasoning paths. However, these two mechanisms and their potential to unlock\nsubstantial improvements remain largely underexplored in industrial ranking\nsystems.\n  In this paper, we propose OnePiece, a unified framework that seamlessly\nintegrates LLM-style context engineering and reasoning into both retrieval and\nranking models of industrial cascaded pipelines. OnePiece is built on a pure\nTransformer backbone and further introduces three key innovations: (1)\nstructured context engineering, which augments interaction history with\npreference and scenario signals and unifies them into a structured tokenized\ninput sequence for both retrieval and ranking; (2) block-wise latent reasoning,\nwhich equips the model with multi-step refinement of representations and scales\nreasoning bandwidth via block size; (3) progressive multi-task training, which\nleverages user feedback chains to effectively supervise reasoning steps during\ntraining. OnePiece has been deployed in the main personalized search scenario\nof Shopee and achieves consistent online gains across different key business\nmetrics, including over +2% GMV/UU and a +2.90% increase in advertising\nrevenue.",

We reveal that existing\nreinforcement learning methods, such as Group Relative Policy Optimization\n(GRPO), rely on on-policy sampling for policy updates. However, in tasks with\nlarge temporal search spaces, this strategy becomes both inefficient and\nlimited in performance, as it often fails to identify temporally accurate\nsolutions. To address this limitation, TempSamp-R1 leverages ground-truth\nannotations as off-policy supervision to provide temporally precise guidance,\neffectively compensating for the sparsity and misalignment in on-policy\nsolutions. To further stabilize training and reduce variance in reward-based\nupdates, TempSamp-R1 provides a non-linear soft advantage computation method\nthat dynamically reshapes the reward feedback via an asymmetric transformation.\nBy employing a hybrid Chain-of-Thought (CoT) training paradigm, TempSamp-R1\noptimizes a single unified model to support both CoT and non-CoT inference\nmodes, enabling efficient handling of queries with varying reasoning\ncomplexity. Experimental results demonstrate that TempSamp-R1 outperforms\nGRPO-based baselines, establishing new state-of-the-art performance on\nbenchmark datasets: Charades-STA (R1@0.7: 52.9%, +2.7%), ActivityNet Captions\n(R1@0.5: 56.0%, +5.3%), and QVHighlights (mAP: 30.0%, +3.0%).

      "summary": "We present Qwen3-Omni, a single multimodal model that, for the first time,\nmaintains state-of-the-art performance across text, image, audio, and video\nwithout any degradation relative to single-modal counterparts. Qwen3-Omni\nmatches the performance of same-sized single-modal models within the Qwen\nseries and excels particularly on audio tasks. Across 36 audio and audio-visual\nbenchmarks, Qwen3-Omni achieves open-source SOTA on 32 benchmarks and overall\nSOTA on 22, outperforming strong closed-source models such as Gemini-2.5-Pro,\nSeed-ASR, and GPT-4o-Transcribe. Qwen3-Omni adopts a Thinker-Talker MoE\narchitecture that unifies perception and generation across text, images, audio,\nand video, yielding fluent text and natural real-time speech. It supports text\ninteraction in 119 languages, speech understanding in 19 languages, and speech\ngeneration in 10 languages. To reduce first-packet latency in streaming\nsynthesis, Talker autoregressively predicts discrete speech codecs using a\nmulti-codebook scheme. Leveraging the representational capacity of these\ncodebooks, we replace computationally intensive block-wise diffusion with a\nlightweight causal ConvNet, enabling streaming from the first codec frame. In\ncold-start settings, Qwen3-Omni achieves a theoretical end-to-end first-packet\nlatency of 234 ms. To further strengthen multimodal reasoning, we introduce a\nThinking model that explicitly reasons over inputs from any modality. Since the\nresearch community currently lacks a general-purpose audio captioning model, we\nfine-tuned Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B to obtain Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Captioner, which\nproduces detailed, low-hallucination captions for arbitrary audio inputs.\nQwen3-Omni-30B-A3B, Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Thinking, and\nQwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Captioner are publicly released under the Apache 2.0\nlicense.",

      "summary": "Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have extended context\nlengths, enabling assistants to sustain long histories for coherent,\npersonalized responses. This ability, however, hinges on Key-Value (KV)\ncaching, whose memory grows linearly with dialogue length and quickly dominates\nunder strict resource constraints. An active line of research for reducing this\noverhead is KV cache compression, which seeks to limit cache size while\npreserving accuracy. Yet existing methods face two major limitations: (i)\nevicting entries after full-context prefill causes unbounded peak memory, and\n(ii) query-dependent eviction narrows the cache to a single query, leading to\ndegraded accuracy in multi-turn conversations. We introduce EpiCache, a\ntraining-free KV cache management framework for long conversational question\nanswering (LongConvQA) under fixed memory budgets. EpiCache bounds cache growth\nthrough block-wise prefill and preserves topic-relevant context via episodic KV\ncompression, which clusters conversation history into coherent episodes and\napplies episode-specific KV cache eviction. We further design an adaptive\nlayer-wise budget allocation strategy that measures each layer's sensitivity to\neviction and distributes the memory budget across layers accordingly. Across\nthree LongConvQA benchmarks, EpiCache improves accuracy by up to 40% over\nrecent baselines, sustains near-full KV accuracy under 4-6x compression, and\nreduces latency and memory by up to 2.4x and 3.5x, thereby enabling efficient\nmulti-turn interaction under strict resource constraints.",

    "title": "EpiCache: Episodic KV Cache Management for Long Conversational Question\n  Answering",
    "summary": "Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have extended context\nlengths, enabling assistants to sustain long histories for coherent,\npersonalized responses. This ability, however, hinges on Key-Value (KV)\ncaching, whose memory grows linearly with dialogue length and quickly dominates\nunder strict resource constraints. An active line of research for reducing this\noverhead is KV cache compression, which seeks to limit cache size while\npreserving accuracy. Yet existing methods face two major limitations: (i)\nevicting entries after full-context prefill causes unbounded peak memory, and\n(ii) query-dependent eviction narrows the cache to a single query, leading to\ndegraded accuracy in multi-turn conversations. We introduce EpiCache, a\ntraining-free KV cache management framework for long conversational question\nanswering (LongConvQA) under fixed memory budgets. EpiCache bounds cache growth\nthrough block-wise prefill and preserves topic-relevant context via episodic KV\ncompression, which clusters conversation history into coherent episodes and\napplies episode-specific KV cache eviction. We further design an adaptive\nlayer-wise budget allocation strategy that measures each layer's sensitivity to\neviction and distributes the memory budget across layers accordingly. Across\nthree LongConvQA benchmarks, EpiCache improves accuracy by up to 40% over\nrecent baselines, sustains near-full KV accuracy under 4-6x compression, and\nreduces latency and memory by up to 2.4x and 3.5x, thereby enabling efficient\nmulti-turn interaction under strict resource constraints.",

Our approach streamlines the 3D graphic design workflow,\nenabling flexible design exploration and rapid production of deliverables. A\nstraightforward approach to synthesizing a video from coarse geometry might\ncondition a video diffusion model on geometric structure. However, existing\nvideo diffusion models struggle to generate high-fidelity results for complex\nscenes due to the difficulty of jointly modeling visual quality, motion, and\ntemporal consistency. To address this, we propose a generative framework that\nleverages the complementary strengths of image and video diffusion models.\nSpecifically, our framework consists of a Sparse Anchor-view Generation (SAG)\nand a Geometry-guided Generative Inbetweening (GGI) module. The SAG module\ngenerates high-quality, cross-view consistent anchor views using an image\ndiffusion model, aided by Sparse Appearance-guided Sampling. Building on these\nanchor views, GGI module faithfully interpolates intermediate frames using a\nvideo diffusion model, enhanced by flow-based camera control and structural\nguidance. Notably, both modules operate without any paired dataset of 3D scene\nmodels and natural images, which is extremely difficult to obtain.\nComprehensive experiments show that our method produces high-quality,\nstyle-consistent scene videos under diverse and challenging scenarios,\noutperforming simple and extended baselines.",

However, existing\nvideo diffusion models struggle to generate high-fidelity results for complex\nscenes due to the difficulty of jointly modeling visual quality, motion, and\ntemporal consistency. To address this, we propose a generative framework that\nleverages the complementary strengths of image and video diffusion models.\nSpecifically, our framework consists of a Sparse Anchor-view Generation (SAG)\nand a Geometry-guided Generative Inbetweening (GGI) module. The SAG module\ngenerates high-quality, cross-view consistent anchor views using an image\ndiffusion model, aided by Sparse Appearance-guided Sampling. Building on these\nanchor views, GGI module faithfully interpolates intermediate frames using a\nvideo diffusion model, enhanced by flow-based camera control and structural\nguidance. Notably, both modules operate without any paired dataset of 3D scene\nmodels and natural images, which is extremely difficult to obtain.\nComprehensive experiments show that our method produces high-quality,\nstyle-consistent scene videos under diverse and challenging scenarios,\noutperforming simple and extended baselines.",

While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems attempt to\naddress this issue by grounding responses in external knowledge, hallucination\nremains a persistent challenge, particularly for morphologically complex,\nlow-resource languages like Turkish. This paper introduces Turk-LettuceDetect,\nthe first suite of hallucination detection models specifically designed for\nTurkish RAG applications. Building on the LettuceDetect framework, we formulate\nhallucination detection as a token-level classification task and fine-tune\nthree distinct encoder architectures: a Turkish-specific ModernBERT,\nTurkEmbed4STS, and multilingual EuroBERT. These models were trained on a\nmachine-translated version of the RAGTruth benchmark dataset containing 17,790\ninstances across question answering, data-to-text generation, and summarization\ntasks. Our experimental results show that the ModernBERT-based model achieves\nan F1-score of 0.7266 on the complete test set, with particularly strong\nperformance on structured tasks. The models maintain computational efficiency\nwhile supporting long contexts up to 8,192 tokens, making them suitable for\nreal-time deployment. Comparative analysis reveals that while state-of-the-art\nLLMs demonstrate high recall, they suffer from low precision due to\nover-generation of hallucinated content, underscoring the necessity of\nspecialized detection mechanisms. By releasing our models and translated\ndataset, this work addresses a critical gap in multilingual NLP and establishes\na foundation for developing more reliable and trustworthy AI applications for\nTurkish and other languages.",

The environment is built on key design principles of high-generality\nproblem distributions, verification via external tools, and continuous\ndifficulty control, which together provide a virtually infinite supply of novel\ntraining instances. Initial zero-shot evaluations with frontier LLMs confirm\nthe difficulty of Reasoning Core's tasks, positioning it as a promising\nresource to improve the reasoning capabilities of future models.",

(2) With our robust learning\nstrategy, PRMs can effectively learn from this weak supervision, achieving a\n39.2 F1 score improvement (from 19.9 to 59.1) in ProcessBench. Despite using\nonly a compact synthetic dataset, our models surpass strong baselines,\nincluding those trained on large-scale human-annotated datasets such as\nPRM800K. Furthermore, performance continues to improve as we scale up the\nsynthetic data, highlighting the potential of SCAN for scalable,\ncost-efficient, and robust PRM training.",
