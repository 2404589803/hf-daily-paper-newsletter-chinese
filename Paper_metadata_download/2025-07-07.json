      "summary": "The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has intensified the\nneed for evaluation frameworks that go beyond English centric benchmarks and\naddress the requirements of linguistically diverse regions such as India. We\npresent EKA-EVAL, a unified and production-ready evaluation framework that\nintegrates over 35 benchmarks, including 10 Indic-specific datasets, spanning\ncategories like reasoning, mathematics, tool use, long-context understanding,\nand reading comprehension. Compared to existing Indian language evaluation\ntools, EKA-EVAL offers broader benchmark coverage, with built-in support for\ndistributed inference, quantization, and multi-GPU usage. Our systematic\ncomparison positions EKA-EVAL as the first end-to-end, extensible evaluation\nsuite tailored for both global and Indic LLMs, significantly lowering the\nbarrier to multilingual benchmarking. The framework is open-source and publicly\navailable at https://github.com/lingo-iitgn/ eka-eval and a part of ongoing EKA\ninitiative (https://eka.soket.ai), which aims to scale up to over 100\nbenchmarks and establish a robust, multilingual evaluation ecosystem for LLMs.",
