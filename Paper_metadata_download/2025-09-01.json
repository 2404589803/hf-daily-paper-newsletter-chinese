      "summary": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) equipped with step-by-step thinking\ncapabilities have demonstrated remarkable performance on complex reasoning\nproblems. However, this thinking process is redundant for simple problems\nsolvable without complex reasoning. To address this inefficiency, we propose\nR-4B, an auto-thinking MLLM, which can adaptively decide when to think based on\nproblem complexity. The central idea of R-4B is to empower the model with both\nthinking and non-thinking capabilities using bi-mode annealing, and apply\nBi-mode Policy Optimization~(BPO) to improve the model's accuracy in\ndetermining whether to activate the thinking process. Specifically, we first\ntrain the model on a carefully curated dataset spanning various topics, which\ncontains samples from both thinking and non-thinking modes. Then it undergoes a\nsecond phase of training under an improved GRPO framework, where the policy\nmodel is forced to generate responses from both modes for each input query.\nExperimental results show that R-4B achieves state-of-the-art performance\nacross 25 challenging benchmarks.

    "summary": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) equipped with step-by-step thinking\ncapabilities have demonstrated remarkable performance on complex reasoning\nproblems. However, this thinking process is redundant for simple problems\nsolvable without complex reasoning. To address this inefficiency, we propose\nR-4B, an auto-thinking MLLM, which can adaptively decide when to think based on\nproblem complexity. The central idea of R-4B is to empower the model with both\nthinking and non-thinking capabilities using bi-mode annealing, and apply\nBi-mode Policy Optimization~(BPO) to improve the model's accuracy in\ndetermining whether to activate the thinking process. Specifically, we first\ntrain the model on a carefully curated dataset spanning various topics, which\ncontains samples from both thinking and non-thinking modes. Then it undergoes a\nsecond phase of training under an improved GRPO framework, where the policy\nmodel is forced to generate responses from both modes for each input query.\nExperimental results show that R-4B achieves state-of-the-art performance\nacross 25 challenging benchmarks.

      "summary": "Symmetry is one of the most fundamental geometric cues in computer vision,\nand detecting it has been an ongoing challenge. With the recent advances in\nvision-language models,~i.e., CLIP, we investigate whether a pre-trained CLIP\nmodel can aid symmetry detection by leveraging the additional symmetry cues\nfound in the natural image descriptions. We propose CLIPSym, which leverages\nCLIP's image and language encoders and a rotation-equivariant decoder based on\na hybrid of Transformer and G-Convolution to detect rotation and reflection\nsymmetries. To fully utilize CLIP's language encoder, we have developed a novel\nprompting technique called Semantic-Aware Prompt Grouping (SAPG), which\naggregates a diverse set of frequent object-based prompts to better integrate\nthe semantic cues for symmetry detection. Empirically, we show that CLIPSym\noutperforms the current state-of-the-art on three standard symmetry detection\ndatasets (DENDI, SDRW, and LDRS). Finally, we conduct detailed ablations\nverifying the benefits of CLIP's pre-training, the proposed equivariant\ndecoder, and the SAPG technique. The code is available at\nhttps://github.com/timyoung2333/CLIPSym.",

    "summary": "Symmetry is one of the most fundamental geometric cues in computer vision,\nand detecting it has been an ongoing challenge. With the recent advances in\nvision-language models,~i.e., CLIP, we investigate whether a pre-trained CLIP\nmodel can aid symmetry detection by leveraging the additional symmetry cues\nfound in the natural image descriptions. We propose CLIPSym, which leverages\nCLIP's image and language encoders and a rotation-equivariant decoder based on\na hybrid of Transformer and G-Convolution to detect rotation and reflection\nsymmetries. To fully utilize CLIP's language encoder, we have developed a novel\nprompting technique called Semantic-Aware Prompt Grouping (SAPG), which\naggregates a diverse set of frequent object-based prompts to better integrate\nthe semantic cues for symmetry detection. Empirically, we show that CLIPSym\noutperforms the current state-of-the-art on three standard symmetry detection\ndatasets (DENDI, SDRW, and LDRS). Finally, we conduct detailed ablations\nverifying the benefits of CLIP's pre-training, the proposed equivariant\ndecoder, and the SAPG technique. The code is available at\nhttps://github.com/timyoung2333/CLIPSym.",
