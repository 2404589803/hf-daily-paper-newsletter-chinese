To mitigate this challenge, we note that\nthe reverse process of diffusion exhibits an inherent entropy-reducing nature.\nGiven the inter-frame redundancy in video modality, maintaining full frame\nrates in high-entropy stages is unnecessary. Based on this insight, we propose\nTPDiff, a unified framework to enhance training and inference efficiency. By\ndividing diffusion into several stages, our framework progressively increases\nframe rate along the diffusion process with only the last stage operating on\nfull frame rate, thereby optimizing computational efficiency. To train the\nmulti-stage diffusion model, we introduce a dedicated training framework:\nstage-wise diffusion. By solving the partitioned probability flow ordinary\ndifferential equations (ODE) of diffusion under aligned data and noise, our\ntraining strategy is applicable to various diffusion forms and further enhances\ntraining efficiency. Comprehensive experimental evaluations validate the\ngenerality of our method, demonstrating 50% reduction in training cost and 1.5x\nimprovement in inference efficiency.",
