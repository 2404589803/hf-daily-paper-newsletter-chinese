However, the\nmajority of 4D capture systems are limited to frame rates below 30 FPS (frames\nper second), and a direct 4D reconstruction of high-speed motion from low FPS\ninput may lead to undesirable results. In this work, we propose a high-speed 4D\ncapturing system only using low FPS cameras, through novel capturing and\nprocessing modules. On the capturing side, we propose an asynchronous capture\nscheme that increases the effective frame rate by staggering the start times of\ncameras. By grouping cameras and leveraging a base frame rate of 25 FPS, our\nmethod achieves an equivalent frame rate of 100-200 FPS without requiring\nspecialized high-speed cameras. On processing side, we also propose a novel\ngenerative model to fix artifacts caused by 4D sparse-view reconstruction, as\nasynchrony reduces the number of viewpoints at each timestamp. Specifically, we\npropose to train a video-diffusion-based artifact-fix model for sparse 4D\nreconstruction, which refines missing details, maintains temporal consistency,\nand improves overall reconstruction quality. Experimental results demonstrate\nthat our method significantly enhances high-speed 4D reconstruction compared to\nsynchronous capture.",

Based on this conceptual insight, we propose a scalable\npre-training method named Policy Discriminative Learning (POLAR), which trains\na reward model (RM) to discern identical policies and discriminate different\nones. Unlike traditional reward modeling methods relying on absolute\npreferences, POLAR captures the relative difference between one policy and an\narbitrary target policy, which is a scalable, high-level optimization objective\nsuitable for modeling generic ranking relationships. Leveraging the POLAR\npre-training paradigm, we present a series of RMs with parameter scales from\n1.8B to 7B. Empirical results show that POLAR substantially outperforms\ntraditional non-pre-trained methods, significantly enhancing RM performance.\nFor instance, POLAR-7B could improve preference accuracy from 54.8% to 81.0% on\nSTEM tasks and from 57.9% to 85.5% on creative writing tasks compared to SOTA\nbaselines. POLAR also shows robust generalization capabilities in RLHF using\nReinforcement Fine-tuning (RFT), providing reliable reward signals and markedly\nenhancing policy performance--improving LLaMa3.1-8B from an average of 47.36%\nto 56.33% and Qwen2.5-32B from 64.49% to 70.47% on 20 benchmarks. Moreover,\nscaling experiments reveal a clear power-law relationship between computation\nand performance, supported by linear correlation coefficients approaching 0.99.\nThe impressive performance, strong generalization, and scaling properties\nsuggest that POLAR is a promising direction for developing general and strong\nreward models.",

To mitigate interference among the dynamic, spatial and\nsemantic information during training, we adopt a block-wise structured\nattention mechanism that masks their mutual attention, preventing information\nleakage and keeping each representation clean and disentangled. Moreover, to\nmodel the conditional distribution over future actions, we employ a\ndiffusion-based transformer that disentangles action representations from\nshared latent features.

      "summary": "Recently, great progress has been achieved in text-to-video (T2V) generation\nby scaling transformer-based diffusion models to billions of parameters, which\ncan generate high-quality videos. However, existing models typically produce\nonly short clips offline, restricting their use cases in interactive and\nreal-time applications. This paper addresses these challenges by proposing\nStreamDiT, a streaming video generation model. StreamDiT training is based on\nflow matching by adding a moving buffer. We design mixed training with\ndifferent partitioning schemes of buffered frames to boost both content\nconsistency and visual quality. StreamDiT modeling is based on adaLN DiT with\nvarying time embedding and window attention. To practice the proposed method,\nwe train a StreamDiT model with 4B parameters. In addition, we propose a\nmultistep distillation method tailored for StreamDiT. Sampling distillation is\nperformed in each segment of a chosen partitioning scheme. After distillation,\nthe total number of function evaluations (NFEs) is reduced to the number of\nchunks in a buffer. Finally, our distilled model reaches real-time performance\nat 16 FPS on one GPU, which can generate video streams at 512p resolution. We\nevaluate our method through both quantitative metrics and human evaluation. Our\nmodel enables real-time applications, e.g. streaming generation, interactive\ngeneration, and video-to-video. We provide video results and more examples in\nour project website: <a href=\"https://cumulo-autumn.github.io/StreamDiT/\">this\nhttps URL.</a>",

    "title": "StreamDiT: Real-Time Streaming Text-to-Video Generation",
    "summary": "Recently, great progress has been achieved in text-to-video (T2V) generation\nby scaling transformer-based diffusion models to billions of parameters, which\ncan generate high-quality videos. However, existing models typically produce\nonly short clips offline, restricting their use cases in interactive and\nreal-time applications. This paper addresses these challenges by proposing\nStreamDiT, a streaming video generation model. StreamDiT training is based on\nflow matching by adding a moving buffer. We design mixed training with\ndifferent partitioning schemes of buffered frames to boost both content\nconsistency and visual quality. StreamDiT modeling is based on adaLN DiT with\nvarying time embedding and window attention. To practice the proposed method,\nwe train a StreamDiT model with 4B parameters. In addition, we propose a\nmultistep distillation method tailored for StreamDiT. Sampling distillation is\nperformed in each segment of a chosen partitioning scheme. After distillation,\nthe total number of function evaluations (NFEs) is reduced to the number of\nchunks in a buffer. Finally, our distilled model reaches real-time performance\nat 16 FPS on one GPU, which can generate video streams at 512p resolution. We\nevaluate our method through both quantitative metrics and human evaluation. Our\nmodel enables real-time applications, e.g. streaming generation, interactive\ngeneration, and video-to-video. We provide video results and more examples in\nour project website: <a href=\"https://cumulo-autumn.github.io/StreamDiT/\">this\nhttps URL.</a>",

To close this\ngap, we propose VLM2Vec-V2, a unified framework for learning embeddings across\ndiverse visual forms.

Next, we\ntrain VLM2Vec-V2, a general-purpose embedding model that supports text, image,\nvideo, and visual document inputs. Extensive experiments show that VLM2Vec-V2\nachieves strong performance not only on the newly introduced video and document\nretrieval tasks, but also improves over prior baselines on the original image\nbenchmarks.

This paper introduces MOD-X (Modular\nOpen Decentralized eXchange), a novel architectural framework proposal for\nagent interoperability that addresses key limitations of existing protocols.\nUnlike current approaches, MOD-X proposes a layered architecture with a\nUniversal Message Bus, thorough state management, translation capabilities, and\nblockchain-based security mechanisms. We present MOD-X's architecture, compare\nit with existing protocols, and demonstrate its application through a worked\nexample how it enables integration between heterogeneous specialist agents\n(agents with different architectures, vendors, capabilities, and knowledge\nrepresentations--including rule-based systems, neural networks, symbolic\nreasoning engines, and legacy software with agent wrappers). MOD-X's key\ninnovations include a publish-subscribe communication model, semantic\ncapability discovery, and dynamic workflow orchestration--providing a framework\nthat bridges theoretical formalism with practical implementation. This\narchitecture addresses the growing need for truly decentralized, interoperable\nagent ecosystems that can scale effectively without the need for central\ncoordination.",

    "title": "MOD-X: A Modular Open Decentralized eXchange Framework proposal for\n  Heterogeneous Interoperable Artificial Agents",
    "summary": "As Artificial Intelligence systems evolve from monolithic models to\necosystems of specialized agents, the need for standardized communication\nprotocols becomes increasingly critical. This paper introduces MOD-X (Modular\nOpen Decentralized eXchange), a novel architectural framework proposal for\nagent interoperability that addresses key limitations of existing protocols.\nUnlike current approaches, MOD-X proposes a layered architecture with a\nUniversal Message Bus, thorough state management, translation capabilities, and\nblockchain-based security mechanisms. We present MOD-X's architecture, compare\nit with existing protocols, and demonstrate its application through a worked\nexample how it enables integration between heterogeneous specialist agents\n(agents with different architectures, vendors, capabilities, and knowledge\nrepresentations--including rule-based systems, neural networks, symbolic\nreasoning engines, and legacy software with agent wrappers). MOD-X's key\ninnovations include a publish-subscribe communication model, semantic\ncapability discovery, and dynamic workflow orchestration--providing a framework\nthat bridges theoretical formalism with practical implementation. This\narchitecture addresses the growing need for truly decentralized, interoperable\nagent ecosystems that can scale effectively without the need for central\ncoordination.",
