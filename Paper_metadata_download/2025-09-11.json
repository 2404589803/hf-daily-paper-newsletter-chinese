Like\nhuman cognitive development, agents are expected to acquire knowledge and\nskills through exploration and interaction with the environment. Despite\nadvances, the community still lacks a unified, interactive reinforcement\nlearning (RL) framework that can effectively train such agents from scratch --\nwithout relying on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) -- across diverse and realistic\nenvironments. To bridge this gap, we introduce AgentGym-RL, a new framework to\ntrain LLM agents for multi-turn interactive decision-making through RL. The\nframework features a modular and decoupled architecture, ensuring high\nflexibility and extensibility. It encompasses a wide variety of real-world\nscenarios, and supports mainstream RL algorithms.

In early stages, it emphasizes exploitation\nby restricting the number of interactions, and gradually shifts towards\nexploration with larger horizons to encourage diverse problem-solving\nstrategies. In this way, the agent develops more diverse behaviors and is less\nprone to collapse under long horizons. We perform extensive experiments to\nvalidate the stability and effectiveness of both the AgentGym-RL framework and\nthe ScalingInter-RL approach. Our agents match or surpass commercial models on\n27 tasks across diverse environments.

This model integrates\nmultiple outputs generated by the Hunyuan-MT-7B model under varying parameter\nsettings, thereby achieving performance superior to that of conventional\nslow-thinking models based on Chain-of-Thought (CoT). The development of our\nmodels follows a holistic training process specifically engineered for\nmultilingual translation, which begins with general and MT-oriented\npre-training to build foundational capabilities, proceeds to Supervised\nFine-Tuning (SFT) for task-specific adaptation, and culminates in advanced\nalignment through Reinforcement Learning (RL) and weak-to-strong RL. Through\ncomprehensive experimentation, we demonstrate that both Hunyuan-MT-7B and\nHunyuan-MT-Chimera-7B significantly outperform all translation-specific models\nof comparable parameter size and most of the SOTA large models, particularly on\nthe task of translation between Mandarin and minority languages as well as\ndialects. In the WMT2025 shared task (General Machine Translation), our models\ndemonstrate state-of-the-art performance, ranking first in 30 out of 31\nlanguage pairs. This result highlights the robustness of our models across a\ndiverse linguistic spectrum, encompassing high-resource languages such as\nChinese, English, and Japanese, as well as low-resource languages including\nCzech, Marathi, Estonian, and Icelandic.",

      "summary": "As humans delegate more tasks and decisions to artificial intelligence (AI),\nwe risk losing control of our individual and collective futures. Relatively\nsimple algorithmic systems already steer human decision-making, such as social\nmedia feed algorithms that lead people to unintentionally and absent-mindedly\nscroll through engagement-optimized content. In this paper, we develop the idea\nof human agency by integrating philosophical and scientific theories of agency\nwith AI-assisted evaluation methods: using large language models (LLMs) to\nsimulate and validate user queries and to evaluate AI responses. We develop\nHumanAgencyBench (HAB), a scalable and adaptive benchmark with six dimensions\nof human agency based on typical AI use cases. HAB measures the tendency of an\nAI assistant or agent to Ask Clarifying Questions, Avoid Value Manipulation,\nCorrect Misinformation, Defer Important Decisions, Encourage Learning, and\nMaintain Social Boundaries. We find low-to-moderate agency support in\ncontemporary LLM-based assistants and substantial variation across system\ndevelopers and dimensions. For example, while Anthropic LLMs most support human\nagency overall, they are the least supportive LLMs in terms of Avoid Value\nManipulation. Agency support does not appear to consistently result from\nincreasing LLM capabilities or instruction-following behavior (e.g., RLHF), and\nwe encourage a shift towards more robust safety and alignment targets.",

    "title": "HumanAgencyBench: Scalable Evaluation of Human Agency Support in AI\n  Assistants",
    "summary": "As humans delegate more tasks and decisions to artificial intelligence (AI),\nwe risk losing control of our individual and collective futures. Relatively\nsimple algorithmic systems already steer human decision-making, such as social\nmedia feed algorithms that lead people to unintentionally and absent-mindedly\nscroll through engagement-optimized content. In this paper, we develop the idea\nof human agency by integrating philosophical and scientific theories of agency\nwith AI-assisted evaluation methods: using large language models (LLMs) to\nsimulate and validate user queries and to evaluate AI responses. We develop\nHumanAgencyBench (HAB), a scalable and adaptive benchmark with six dimensions\nof human agency based on typical AI use cases. HAB measures the tendency of an\nAI assistant or agent to Ask Clarifying Questions, Avoid Value Manipulation,\nCorrect Misinformation, Defer Important Decisions, Encourage Learning, and\nMaintain Social Boundaries. We find low-to-moderate agency support in\ncontemporary LLM-based assistants and substantial variation across system\ndevelopers and dimensions. For example, while Anthropic LLMs most support human\nagency overall, they are the least supportive LLMs in terms of Avoid Value\nManipulation. Agency support does not appear to consistently result from\nincreasing LLM capabilities or instruction-following behavior (e.g., RLHF), and\nwe encourage a shift towards more robust safety and alignment targets.",
