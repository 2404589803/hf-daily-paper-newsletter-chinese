In this work, we\npropose autoregressive adversarial post-training (AAPT) to transform a\npre-trained latent video diffusion model into a real-time, interactive video\ngenerator. Our model autoregressively generates a latent frame at a time using\na single neural function evaluation (1NFE). The model can stream the result to\nthe user in real time and receive interactive responses as controls to generate\nthe next latent frame. Unlike existing approaches, our method explores\nadversarial training as an effective paradigm for autoregressive generation.\nThis not only allows us to design an architecture that is more efficient for\none-step generation while fully utilizing the KV cache, but also enables\ntraining the model in a student-forcing manner that proves to be effective in\nreducing error accumulation during long video generation. Our experiments\ndemonstrate that our 8B model achieves real-time, 24fps, streaming video\ngeneration at 736x416 resolution on a single H100, or 1280x720 on 8xH100 up to\na minute long (1440 frames).

To address this\nchallenge, we propose POET, a novel reParameterized training algorithm that\nuses Orthogonal Equivalence Transformation to optimize neurons. Specifically,\nPOET reparameterizes each neuron with two learnable orthogonal matrices and a\nfixed random weight matrix. Because of its provable preservation of spectral\nproperties of weight matrices, POET can stably optimize the objective function\nwith improved generalization. We further develop efficient approximations that\nmake POET flexible and scalable for training large-scale neural networks.\nExtensive experiments validate the effectiveness and scalability of POET in\ntraining LLMs.",

    "title": "Reparameterized LLM Training via Orthogonal Equivalence Transformation",
    "summary": "While large language models (LLMs) are driving the rapid advancement of\nartificial intelligence, effectively and reliably training these large models\nremains one of the field's most significant challenges. To address this\nchallenge, we propose POET, a novel reParameterized training algorithm that\nuses Orthogonal Equivalence Transformation to optimize neurons. Specifically,\nPOET reparameterizes each neuron with two learnable orthogonal matrices and a\nfixed random weight matrix. Because of its provable preservation of spectral\nproperties of weight matrices, POET can stably optimize the objective function\nwith improved generalization. We further develop efficient approximations that\nmake POET flexible and scalable for training large-scale neural networks.\nExtensive experiments validate the effectiveness and scalability of POET in\ntraining LLMs.",
