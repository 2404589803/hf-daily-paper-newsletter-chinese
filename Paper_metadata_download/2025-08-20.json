    "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) require sophisticated prompting, yet current\npractices face challenges in structure, data integration, format sensitivity,\nand tooling. Existing methods lack comprehensive solutions for organizing\ncomplex prompts involving diverse data types (documents, tables, images) or\nmanaging presentation variations systematically. To address these gaps, we\nintroduce POML (Prompt Orchestration Markup Language). POML employs\ncomponent-based markup for logical structure (roles, tasks, examples),\nspecialized tags for seamless data integration, and a CSS-like styling system\nto decouple content from presentation, reducing formatting sensitivity. It\nincludes templating for dynamic prompts and a comprehensive developer toolkit\n(IDE support, SDKs) to improve version control and collaboration. We validate\nPOML through two case studies demonstrating its impact on complex application\nintegration (PomLink) and accuracy performance (TableQA), as well as a user\nstudy assessing its effectiveness in real-world development scenarios.",

We observed that the model after the first stage shows\nquick convergence even with few paired samples. OmniTry is evaluated on a\ncomprehensive benchmark consisting of 12 common classes of wearable objects,\nwith both in-shop and in-the-wild images. Experimental results suggest that\nOmniTry shows better performance on both object localization and\nID-preservation compared with existing methods. The code, model weights, and\nevaluation benchmark of OmniTry will be made publicly available at\nhttps://omnitry.github.io/.",

Unlike existing benchmarks, MMAU-Pro\nevaluates auditory intelligence across 49 unique skills and multiple complex\ndimensions, including long-form audio comprehension, spatial audio reasoning,\nmulti-audio understanding, among others.

Importantly, audio data is\nsourced directly ``from the wild\" rather than from existing datasets with known\ndistributions. We evaluate 22 leading open-source and proprietary multimodal AI\nmodels, revealing significant limitations: even state-of-the-art models such as\nGemini 2.5 Flash and Audio Flamingo 3 achieve only 59.2% and 51.7% accuracy,\nrespectively, approaching random performance in multiple categories.

Extensive experiments on\n8 HAR benchmarks show that ZARA achieves SOTA zero-shot performance, delivering\nclear reasoning while exceeding the strongest baselines by 2.53x in macro F1.\nAblation studies further confirm the necessity of each module, marking ZARA as\na promising step toward trustworthy, plug-and-play motion time-series analysis.\nOur codes are available at https://github.com/zechenli03/ZARA.",
