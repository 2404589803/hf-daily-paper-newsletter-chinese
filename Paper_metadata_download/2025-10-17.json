      "summary": "Recently, Agentic Reinforcement Learning (Agentic RL) has made significant\nprogress in incentivizing the multi-turn, long-horizon tool-use capabilities of\nweb agents. While mainstream agentic RL algorithms autonomously explore\nhigh-uncertainty tool-call steps under the guidance of entropy, excessive\nreliance on entropy signals can impose further constraints, leading to the\ntraining collapse. In this paper, we delve into the challenges caused by\nentropy and propose the Agentic Entropy-Balanced Policy Optimization (AEPO), an\nagentic RL algorithm designed to balance entropy in both the rollout and policy\nupdate phases. AEPO comprises two core components: (1) a dynamic\nentropy-balanced rollout mechanism that adaptively allocate global and branch\nsampling budget through entropy pre-monitoring, while imposing a branch penalty\non consecutive high-entropy tool-call steps to prevent over-branching issues;\nand (2) Entropy-Balanced Policy Optimization that inserts a stop-gradient\noperation into the high-entropy clipping term to preserve and properly rescale\ngradients on high-entropy tokens, while incorporating entropy-aware advantage\nestimation to prioritize learning on high-uncertainty tokens. Results across 14\nchallenging datasets show that AEPO consistently outperforms 7 mainstream RL\nalgorithms. With just 1K RL samples, Qwen3-14B with AEPO achieves impressive\nresults: 47.6% on GAIA, 11.2% on Humanity's Last Exam, and 43.0% on WebWalker\nfor Pass@1; 65.0% on GAIA, 26.0% on Humanity's Last Exam, and 70.0% on\nWebWalker for Pass@5.

      "summary": "Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as\na core paradigm for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language\nModels (LLMs). To address the lack of verification signals at test time, prior\nstudies incorporate the training of model's self-verification capability into\nthe standard RLVR process, thereby unifying reasoning and verification\ncapabilities within a single LLM. However, previous practice requires the LLM\nto sequentially generate solutions and self-verifications using two separate\nprompt templates, which significantly reduces efficiency. In this work, we\ntheoretically reveal that the closed-form solution to the RL objective of\nself-verification can be reduced to a remarkably simple form: the true\nreasoning reward of a solution is equal to its last-token self-rewarding score,\nwhich is computed as the difference between the policy model's next-token\nlog-probability assigned to any pre-specified token at the solution's last\ntoken and a pre-calculated constant, scaled by the KL coefficient. Based on\nthis insight, we propose LaSeR (Reinforcement Learning with Last-Token\nSelf-Rewarding), an algorithm that simply augments the original RLVR loss with\na MSE loss that aligns the last-token self-rewarding scores with verifier-based\nreasoning rewards, jointly optimizing the reasoning and self-rewarding\ncapabilities of LLMs. The optimized self-rewarding scores can be utilized in\nboth training and testing to enhance model performance. Notably, our algorithm\nderives these scores from the predicted next-token probability distribution of\nthe last token immediately after generation, incurring only the minimal extra\ncost of one additional token inference. Experiments show that our method not\nonly improves the model's reasoning performance but also equips it with\nremarkable self-rewarding capability, thereby boosting its inference-time\nscaling performance.",

    "summary": "Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as\na core paradigm for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language\nModels (LLMs). To address the lack of verification signals at test time, prior\nstudies incorporate the training of model's self-verification capability into\nthe standard RLVR process, thereby unifying reasoning and verification\ncapabilities within a single LLM. However, previous practice requires the LLM\nto sequentially generate solutions and self-verifications using two separate\nprompt templates, which significantly reduces efficiency. In this work, we\ntheoretically reveal that the closed-form solution to the RL objective of\nself-verification can be reduced to a remarkably simple form: the true\nreasoning reward of a solution is equal to its last-token self-rewarding score,\nwhich is computed as the difference between the policy model's next-token\nlog-probability assigned to any pre-specified token at the solution's last\ntoken and a pre-calculated constant, scaled by the KL coefficient. Based on\nthis insight, we propose LaSeR (Reinforcement Learning with Last-Token\nSelf-Rewarding), an algorithm that simply augments the original RLVR loss with\na MSE loss that aligns the last-token self-rewarding scores with verifier-based\nreasoning rewards, jointly optimizing the reasoning and self-rewarding\ncapabilities of LLMs. The optimized self-rewarding scores can be utilized in\nboth training and testing to enhance model performance. Notably, our algorithm\nderives these scores from the predicted next-token probability distribution of\nthe last token immediately after generation, incurring only the minimal extra\ncost of one additional token inference. Experiments show that our method not\nonly improves the model's reasoning performance but also equips it with\nremarkable self-rewarding capability, thereby boosting its inference-time\nscaling performance.",

These prompts often involve rarely co-occurring\nconcepts with long-distance semantic relationships, falling outside training\ndistributions. Existing methods typically apply test-time scaling for improving\nvideo quality, but their fixed search spaces and static reward designs limit\nadaptability to imaginative scenarios. To fill this gap, we propose\nImagerySearch, a prompt-guided adaptive test-time search strategy that\ndynamically adjusts both the inference search space and reward function\naccording to semantic relationships in the prompt.

To evaluate\nprogress in this direction, we introduce LDT-Bench, the first dedicated\nbenchmark for long-distance semantic prompts, consisting of 2,839 diverse\nconcept pairs and an automated protocol for assessing creative generation\ncapabilities. Extensive experiments show that ImagerySearch consistently\noutperforms strong video generation baselines and existing test-time scaling\napproaches on LDT-Bench, and achieves competitive improvements on VBench,\ndemonstrating its effectiveness across diverse prompt types. We will release\nLDT-Bench and code to facilitate future research on imaginative video\ngeneration.",

Prior methods' decoders recompute QKV for all\ntokens at every denoising step and layer, despite KV states changing little\nacross most steps, especially in shallow layers, leading to substantial\nredundancy. We make three observations: (1) distant {bf MASK} tokens\nprimarily act as a length-bias and can be cached block-wise beyond the active\nprediction window; (2) KV dynamics increase with depth, suggesting that\nselective refresh starting from deeper layers is sufficient; and (3) the\nmost-attended token exhibits the smallest KV drift, providing a conservative\nlower bound on cache change for other tokens. Building on these, we propose\n{bf Elastic-Cache}, a training-free, architecture-agnostic strategy that\njointly decides {when} to refresh (via an attention-aware drift test on the\nmost-attended token) and {where} to refresh (via a depth-aware schedule that\nrecomputes from a chosen layer onward while reusing shallow-layer caches and\noff-window MASK caches). Unlike fixed-period schemes, Elastic-Cache performs\nadaptive, layer-aware cache updates for diffusion LLMs, reducing redundant\ncomputation and accelerating decoding with negligible loss in generation\nquality. Experiments on LLaDA-Instruct, LLaDA-1.5, and LLaDA-V across\nmathematical reasoning and code generation tasks demonstrate consistent\nspeedups: 8.7times on GSM8K (256 tokens), 45.1times on longer sequences,\nand 4.8times on HumanEval, while consistently maintaining higher accuracy\nthan the baseline. Our method achieves significantly higher throughput\n(6.8times on GSM8K) than existing confidence-based approaches while\npreserving generation quality, enabling practical deployment of diffusion LLMs.",

Experimental results show\nthat BitDistill achieves performance comparable to the full-precision\ncounterpart models across model size, while enabling up to 10x memory savings\nand 2.65x faster inference on CPUs.

Specifically, BitDistill incorporates three key techniques: the SubLN\nmodule, as introduced in BitNet; multi-head attention distillation, based on\nMiniLM; and continual pre-training, which serves as a crucial warm-up step to\nmitigate the scalability issue of the performance gap between finetuned\nfull-precision and 1.58-bit LLMs on specific tasks. Experimental results show\nthat BitDistill achieves performance comparable to the full-precision\ncounterpart models across model size, while enabling up to 10x memory savings\nand 2.65x faster inference on CPUs. Code is available at\nhttps://github.com/microsoft/BitNet.",

To bridge\nthis gap, we introduce MathCanvas, a comprehensive framework designed to endow\nunified Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) with intrinsic VCoT capabilities for\nmathematics.

      "summary": "Recent work suggests that large language models (LLMs) encode factuality\nsignals in their internal representations, such as hidden states, attention\nweights, or token probabilities, implying that LLMs may \"know what they don't\nknow\". However, LLMs can also produce factual errors by relying on shortcuts or\nspurious associations. These error are driven by the same training objective\nthat encourage correct predictions, raising the question of whether internal\ncomputations can reliably distinguish between factual and hallucinated outputs.\nIn this work, we conduct a mechanistic analysis of how LLMs internally process\nfactual queries by comparing two types of hallucinations based on their\nreliance on subject information. We find that when hallucinations are\nassociated with subject knowledge, LLMs employ the same internal recall process\nas for correct responses, leading to overlapping and indistinguishable\nhidden-state geometries. In contrast, hallucinations detached from subject\nknowledge produce distinct, clustered representations that make them\ndetectable. These findings reveal a fundamental limitation: LLMs do not encode\ntruthfulness in their internal states but only patterns of knowledge recall,\ndemonstrating that \"LLMs don't really know what they don't know\".",

    "title": "Large Language Models Do NOT Really Know What They Don't Know",
    "summary": "Recent work suggests that large language models (LLMs) encode factuality\nsignals in their internal representations, such as hidden states, attention\nweights, or token probabilities, implying that LLMs may \"know what they don't\nknow\". However, LLMs can also produce factual errors by relying on shortcuts or\nspurious associations. These error are driven by the same training objective\nthat encourage correct predictions, raising the question of whether internal\ncomputations can reliably distinguish between factual and hallucinated outputs.\nIn this work, we conduct a mechanistic analysis of how LLMs internally process\nfactual queries by comparing two types of hallucinations based on their\nreliance on subject information. We find that when hallucinations are\nassociated with subject knowledge, LLMs employ the same internal recall process\nas for correct responses, leading to overlapping and indistinguishable\nhidden-state geometries. In contrast, hallucinations detached from subject\nknowledge produce distinct, clustered representations that make them\ndetectable. These findings reveal a fundamental limitation: LLMs do not encode\ntruthfulness in their internal states but only patterns of knowledge recall,\ndemonstrating that \"LLMs don't really know what they don't know\".",

      "summary": "Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) hold immense promise for enabling\ngeneralist robot manipulation. However, the best way to build them remains an\nopen question. Current approaches often add complexity, such as modifying the\nexisting vocabulary of a Vision-Language Model (VLM) with action tokens or\nintroducing special action heads. Curiously, the simplest strategy of\nrepresenting actions directly as text has remained largely unexplored. This\nwork introduces VLA-0 to investigate this idea. We find that VLA-0 is not only\neffective; it is surprisingly powerful. With the right design, VLA-0\noutperforms more involved models.

    "summary": "Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) hold immense promise for enabling\ngeneralist robot manipulation. However, the best way to build them remains an\nopen question. Current approaches often add complexity, such as modifying the\nexisting vocabulary of a Vision-Language Model (VLM) with action tokens or\nintroducing special action heads. Curiously, the simplest strategy of\nrepresenting actions directly as text has remained largely unexplored. This\nwork introduces VLA-0 to investigate this idea. We find that VLA-0 is not only\neffective; it is surprisingly powerful. With the right design, VLA-0\noutperforms more involved models. On LIBERO, a popular benchmark for evaluating\nVLAs, VLA-0 outperforms all existing methods trained on the same robotic data,\nincluding pi_0.5-KI, OpenVLA-OFT and SmolVLA.

      "summary": "Video generative models have recently achieved notable advancements in\nsynthesis quality. However, generating complex motions remains a critical\nchallenge, as existing models often struggle to produce natural, smooth, and\ncontextually consistent movements. This gap between generated and real-world\nmotions limits their practical applicability. To address this issue, we\nintroduce RealDPO, a novel alignment paradigm that leverages real-world data as\npositive samples for preference learning, enabling more accurate motion\nsynthesis. Unlike traditional supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which offers\nlimited corrective feedback, RealDPO employs Direct Preference Optimization\n(DPO) with a tailored loss function to enhance motion realism. By contrasting\nreal-world videos with erroneous model outputs, RealDPO enables iterative\nself-correction, progressively refining motion quality. To support\npost-training in complex motion synthesis, we propose RealAction-5K, a curated\ndataset of high-quality videos capturing human daily activities with rich and\nprecise motion details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RealDPO\nsignificantly improves video quality, text alignment, and motion realism\ncompared to state-of-the-art models and existing preference optimization\ntechniques.",

    "summary": "Video generative models have recently achieved notable advancements in\nsynthesis quality. However, generating complex motions remains a critical\nchallenge, as existing models often struggle to produce natural, smooth, and\ncontextually consistent movements. This gap between generated and real-world\nmotions limits their practical applicability. To address this issue, we\nintroduce RealDPO, a novel alignment paradigm that leverages real-world data as\npositive samples for preference learning, enabling more accurate motion\nsynthesis. Unlike traditional supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which offers\nlimited corrective feedback, RealDPO employs Direct Preference Optimization\n(DPO) with a tailored loss function to enhance motion realism. By contrasting\nreal-world videos with erroneous model outputs, RealDPO enables iterative\nself-correction, progressively refining motion quality. To support\npost-training in complex motion synthesis, we propose RealAction-5K, a curated\ndataset of high-quality videos capturing human daily activities with rich and\nprecise motion details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RealDPO\nsignificantly improves video quality, text alignment, and motion realism\ncompared to state-of-the-art models and existing preference optimization\ntechniques.",

This format mismatch has led to complex distillation procedures\nthat often suffer from a quality-diversity trade-off. To address this, we\npropose policy-based flow models (pi-Flow). pi-Flow modifies the output\nlayer of a student flow model to predict a network-free policy at one timestep.\nThe policy then produces dynamic flow velocities at future substeps with\nnegligible overhead, enabling fast and accurate ODE integration on these\nsubsteps without extra network evaluations. To match the policy's ODE\ntrajectory to the teacher's, we introduce a novel imitation distillation\napproach, which matches the policy's velocity to the teacher's along the\npolicy's trajectory using a standard ell_2 flow matching loss. By simply\nmimicking the teacher's behavior, pi-Flow enables stable and scalable\ntraining and avoids the quality-diversity trade-off. On ImageNet 256^2, it\nattains a 1-NFE FID of 2.85, outperforming MeanFlow of the same DiT\narchitecture. On FLUX.1-12B and Qwen-Image-20B at 4 NFEs, pi-Flow achieves\nsubstantially better diversity than state-of-the-art few-step methods, while\nmaintaining teacher-level quality.",

    "summary": "Few-step diffusion or flow-based generative models typically distill a\nvelocity-predicting teacher into a student that predicts a shortcut towards\ndenoised data. This format mismatch has led to complex distillation procedures\nthat often suffer from a quality-diversity trade-off. To address this, we\npropose policy-based flow models (pi-Flow). pi-Flow modifies the output\nlayer of a student flow model to predict a network-free policy at one timestep.\nThe policy then produces dynamic flow velocities at future substeps with\nnegligible overhead, enabling fast and accurate ODE integration on these\nsubsteps without extra network evaluations. To match the policy's ODE\ntrajectory to the teacher's, we introduce a novel imitation distillation\napproach, which matches the policy's velocity to the teacher's along the\npolicy's trajectory using a standard ell_2 flow matching loss. By simply\nmimicking the teacher's behavior, pi-Flow enables stable and scalable\ntraining and avoids the quality-diversity trade-off. On ImageNet 256^2, it\nattains a 1-NFE FID of 2.85, outperforming MeanFlow of the same DiT\narchitecture. On FLUX.1-12B and Qwen-Image-20B at 4 NFEs, pi-Flow achieves\nsubstantially better diversity than state-of-the-art few-step methods, while\nmaintaining teacher-level quality.",

      "summary": "The traditional RAG paradigm, which typically engages in the comprehension of\nrelevant text chunks in response to received queries, inherently restricts both\nthe depth of knowledge internalization and reasoning capabilities. To address\nthis limitation, our research transforms the text processing in RAG from\npassive chunking to proactive understanding, defining this process as document\nmemory extraction with the objective of simulating human cognitive processes\nduring reading. Building upon this, we propose the Mixtures of scenario-aware\ndocument Memories (MoM) framework, engineered to efficiently handle documents\nfrom multiple domains and train small language models (SLMs) to acquire the\nability to proactively explore and construct document memories. The MoM\ninitially instructs large language models (LLMs) to simulate domain experts in\ngenerating document logical outlines, thereby directing structured chunking and\ncore content extraction. It employs a multi-path sampling and multi-perspective\nevaluation mechanism, specifically designing comprehensive metrics that\nrepresent chunk clarity and extraction completeness to select the optimal\ndocument memories. Additionally, to infuse deeper human-like reading abilities\nduring the training of SLMs, we incorporate a reverse reasoning strategy, which\ndeduces refined expert thinking paths from high-quality outcomes. Finally,\nleveraging diverse forms of content generated by MoM, we develop a three-layer\ndocument memory retrieval mechanism, which is grounded in our theoretical proof\nfrom the perspective of probabilistic modeling. Extensive experimental results\nacross three distinct domains demonstrate that the MoM framework not only\nresolves text chunking challenges in existing RAG systems, providing LLMs with\nsemantically complete document memories, but also paves the way for SLMs to\nachieve human-centric intelligent text processing.",

    "summary": "The traditional RAG paradigm, which typically engages in the comprehension of\nrelevant text chunks in response to received queries, inherently restricts both\nthe depth of knowledge internalization and reasoning capabilities. To address\nthis limitation, our research transforms the text processing in RAG from\npassive chunking to proactive understanding, defining this process as document\nmemory extraction with the objective of simulating human cognitive processes\nduring reading. Building upon this, we propose the Mixtures of scenario-aware\ndocument Memories (MoM) framework, engineered to efficiently handle documents\nfrom multiple domains and train small language models (SLMs) to acquire the\nability to proactively explore and construct document memories. The MoM\ninitially instructs large language models (LLMs) to simulate domain experts in\ngenerating document logical outlines, thereby directing structured chunking and\ncore content extraction. It employs a multi-path sampling and multi-perspective\nevaluation mechanism, specifically designing comprehensive metrics that\nrepresent chunk clarity and extraction completeness to select the optimal\ndocument memories. Additionally, to infuse deeper human-like reading abilities\nduring the training of SLMs, we incorporate a reverse reasoning strategy, which\ndeduces refined expert thinking paths from high-quality outcomes. Finally,\nleveraging diverse forms of content generated by MoM, we develop a three-layer\ndocument memory retrieval mechanism, which is grounded in our theoretical proof\nfrom the perspective of probabilistic modeling. Extensive experimental results\nacross three distinct domains demonstrate that the MoM framework not only\nresolves text chunking challenges in existing RAG systems, providing LLMs with\nsemantically complete document memories, but also paves the way for SLMs to\nachieve human-centric intelligent text processing.",

We propose SCas4D, a cascaded\noptimization framework that leverages structural patterns in 3D Gaussian\nSplatting for dynamic scenes. The key idea is that real-world deformations\noften exhibit hierarchical patterns, where groups of Gaussians share similar\ntransformations. By progressively refining deformations from coarse part-level\nto fine point-level, SCas4D achieves convergence within 100 iterations per time\nframe and produces results comparable to existing methods with only\none-twentieth of the training iterations. The approach also demonstrates\neffectiveness in self-supervised articulated object segmentation, novel view\nsynthesis, and dense point tracking tasks.",
