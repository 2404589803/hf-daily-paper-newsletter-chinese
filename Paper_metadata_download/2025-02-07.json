      "summary": "We introduce a new approach to systematically map features discovered by\nsparse autoencoder across consecutive layers of large language models,\nextending earlier work that examined inter-layer feature links. By using a\ndata-free cosine similarity technique, we trace how specific features persist,\ntransform, or first appear at each stage. This method yields granular flow\ngraphs of feature evolution, enabling fine-grained interpretability and\nmechanistic insights into model computations. Crucially, we demonstrate how\nthese cross-layer feature maps facilitate direct steering of model behavior by\namplifying or suppressing chosen features, achieving targeted thematic control\nin text generation. Together, our findings highlight the utility of a causal,\ncross-layer interpretability framework that not only clarifies how features\ndevelop through forward passes but also provides new means for transparent\nmanipulation of large language models.",

      "summary": "We present AlphaGeometry2, a significantly improved version of AlphaGeometry\nintroduced in Trinh et al. (2024), which has now surpassed an average gold\nmedalist in solving Olympiad geometry problems. To achieve this, we first\nextend the original AlphaGeometry language to tackle harder problems involving\nmovements of objects, and problems containing linear equations of angles,\nratios, and distances. This, together with other additions, has markedly\nimproved the coverage rate of the AlphaGeometry language on International Math\nOlympiads (IMO) 2000-2024 geometry problems from 66% to 88%. The search process\nof AlphaGeometry2 has also been greatly improved through the use of Gemini\narchitecture for better language modeling, and a novel knowledge-sharing\nmechanism that combines multiple search trees. Together with further\nenhancements to the symbolic engine and synthetic data generation, we have\nsignificantly boosted the overall solving rate of AlphaGeometry2 to 84% for\nall geometry problems over the last 25 years, compared to 54%\npreviously. AlphaGeometry2 was also part of the system that achieved\nsilver-medal standard at IMO 2024 https://dpmd.ai/imo-silver. Last but not\nleast, we report progress towards using AlphaGeometry2 as a part of a fully\nautomated system that reliably solves geometry problems directly from natural\nlanguage input.",

      "summary": "Recent research has leveraged large language model multi-agent systems for\ncomplex problem-solving while trying to reduce the manual effort required to\nbuild them, driving the development of automated agent workflow optimization\nmethods. However, existing methods remain inflexible due to representational\nlimitations, a lack of adaptability, and poor scalability when relying on\ndiscrete optimization techniques. We address these challenges with ScoreFlow, a\nsimple yet high-performance framework that leverages efficient gradient-based\noptimization in a continuous space. ScoreFlow incorporates Score-DPO, a novel\nvariant of the direct preference optimization method that accounts for\nquantitative feedback. Across six benchmarks spanning question answering,\ncoding, and mathematical reasoning, ScoreFlow achieves an 8.2% improvement over\nexisting baselines. Moreover, it empowers smaller models to outperform larger\nones with lower inference costs. Project:\nhttps://github.com/Gen-Verse/ScoreFlow",

      "title": "Ola: Pushing the Frontiers of Omni-Modal Language Model with Progressive\n  Modality Alignment",
      "summary": "Recent advances in large language models, particularly following GPT-4o, have\nsparked increasing interest in developing omni-modal models capable of\nunderstanding more modalities. While some open-source alternatives have\nemerged, there is still a notable lag behind specialized single-modality models\nin performance. In this paper, we present Ola, an Omni-modal language model\nthat achieves competitive performance across image, video, and audio\nunderstanding compared to specialized counterparts. The core design of Ola lies\nin its progressive modality alignment strategy that extends the supporting\nmodality of the language model progressively. Our training pipeline begins with\nthe most distinct modalities: image and text, then gradually expands the skill\nsets of the model using speech data that connects language and audio knowledge,\nand video data that connects all modalities. The progressive learning pipeline\nalso enables us to maintain a relatively small size of the cross-modal\nalignment data, making developing omni-modal from existing vision-language\nmodels easy and less costly. Moreover, to unlock an advanced interactive\nexperience like GPT-4o, we further design a sentence-wise decoding solution for\nstreaming speech generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Ola\nsurpasses existing open omni-modal LLMs across all modalities while achieving\nhighly competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art specialized models\nof similar sizes. We aim to make Ola a fully open omni-modal understanding\nsolution to advance future research in this emerging field.

However, the key to taming LLMs on complex instructions remains\nmysterious, for that there are huge gaps between models trained by open-source\ncommunity and those trained by leading companies. To bridge the gap, we propose\na simple and scalable approach UltraIF for building LLMs that can follow\ncomplex instructions with open-source data. UltraIF first decomposes real-world\nuser prompts into simpler queries, constraints, and corresponding evaluation\nquestions for the constraints. Then, we train an UltraComposer to compose\nconstraint-associated prompts with evaluation questions. This prompt composer\nallows us to synthesize complicated instructions as well as filter responses\nwith evaluation questions. In our experiment, for the first time, we\nsuccessfully align LLaMA-3.1-8B-Base to catch up with its instruct version on 5\ninstruction-following benchmarks without any benchmark information, using only\n8B model as response generator and evaluator. The aligned model also achieved\ncompetitive scores on other benchmarks. Moreover, we also show that UltraIF\ncould further improve LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct through self-alignment, motivating\nbroader use cases for the method.

      "title": "MotionLab: Unified Human Motion Generation and Editing via the\n  Motion-Condition-Motion Paradigm",
      "summary": "Human motion generation and editing are key components of computer graphics\nand vision. However, current approaches in this field tend to offer isolated\nsolutions tailored to specific tasks, which can be inefficient and impractical\nfor real-world applications. While some efforts have aimed to unify\nmotion-related tasks, these methods simply use different modalities as\nconditions to guide motion generation. Consequently, they lack editing\ncapabilities, fine-grained control, and fail to facilitate knowledge sharing\nacross tasks. To address these limitations and provide a versatile, unified\nframework capable of handling both human motion generation and editing, we\nintroduce a novel paradigm: Motion-Condition-Motion, which enables the unified\nformulation of diverse tasks with three concepts: source motion, condition, and\ntarget motion. Based on this paradigm, we propose a unified framework,\nMotionLab, which incorporates rectified flows to learn the mapping from source\nmotion to target motion, guided by the specified conditions. In MotionLab, we\nintroduce the 1) MotionFlow Transformer to enhance conditional generation and\nediting without task-specific modules; 2) Aligned Rotational Position Encoding}\nto guarantee the time synchronization between source motion and target motion;\n3) Task Specified Instruction Modulation; and 4) Motion Curriculum Learning for\neffective multi-task learning and knowledge sharing across tasks. Notably, our\nMotionLab demonstrates promising generalization capabilities and inference\nefficiency across multiple benchmarks for human motion.

      "summary": "Recent advances in text-based large language models (LLMs), particularly in\nthe GPT series and the o1 model, have demonstrated the effectiveness of scaling\nboth training-time and inference-time compute. However, current\nstate-of-the-art TTS systems leveraging LLMs are often multi-stage, requiring\nseparate models (e.g., diffusion models after LLM), complicating the decision\nof whether to scale a particular model during training or testing. This work\nmakes the following contributions: First, we explore the scaling of train-time\nand inference-time compute for speech synthesis. Second, we propose a simple\nframework Llasa for speech synthesis that employs a single-layer vector\nquantizer (VQ) codec and a single Transformer architecture to fully align with\nstandard LLMs such as Llama. Our experiments reveal that scaling train-time\ncompute for Llasa consistently improves the naturalness of synthesized speech\nand enables the generation of more complex and accurate prosody patterns.\nFurthermore, from the perspective of scaling inference-time compute, we employ\nspeech understanding models as verifiers during the search, finding that\nscaling inference-time compute shifts the sampling modes toward the preferences\nof specific verifiers, thereby improving emotional expressiveness, timbre\nconsistency, and content accuracy. In addition, we released the checkpoint and\ntraining code for our TTS model (1B, 3B, 8B) and codec model publicly\navailable.",

      "title": "BOLT: Bootstrap Long Chain-of-Thought in Language Models without\n  Distillation",
      "summary": "Large language models (LLMs), such as o1 from OpenAI, have demonstrated\nremarkable reasoning capabilities. o1 generates a long chain-of-thought\n(LongCoT) before answering a question. LongCoT allows LLMs to analyze problems,\ndevise plans, reflect, and backtrack effectively. These actions empower LLM to\nsolve complex problems. After the release of o1, many teams have attempted to\nreplicate its LongCoT and reasoning capabilities. In terms of methods, they\nprimarily rely on knowledge distillation with data from existing models with\nLongCoT capacities (e.g., OpenAI-o1, Qwen-QwQ, DeepSeek-R1-Preview), leaving\nsignificant uncertainties on systematically developing such reasoning\nabilities. In terms of data domains, these works focus narrowly on math while a\nfew others include coding, limiting their generalizability. This paper\nintroduces a novel approach to enable LLM's LongCoT capacity without\ndistillation from o1-like models or expensive human annotations, where we\nbootstrap LongCoT (BOLT) from a standard instruct model. BOLT involves three\nstages: 1) LongCoT data bootstrapping with in-context learning on a standard\ninstruct model; 2) LongCoT supervised finetuning; 3) online training to further\nrefine LongCoT capacities. In BOLT, only a few in-context examples need to be\nconstructed during the bootstrapping stage; in our experiments, we created 10\nexamples, demonstrating the feasibility of this approach. We use\nLlama-3.1-70B-Instruct to bootstrap LongCoT and apply our method to various\nmodel scales (7B, 8B, 70B). We achieve impressive performance on a variety of\nbenchmarks, Arena-Hard, MT-Bench, WildBench, ZebraLogic, MATH500, which\nevaluate diverse task-solving and reasoning capabilities.",

While\nrecent research has focused on optimizing prompt content, the role of prompt\nformatting, a critical but often overlooked dimension, has received limited\nsystematic investigation. In this paper, we introduce Content-Format Integrated\nPrompt Optimization (CFPO), an innovative methodology that jointly optimizes\nboth prompt content and formatting through an iterative refinement process.\nCFPO leverages natural language mutations to explore content variations and\nemploys a dynamic format exploration strategy that systematically evaluates\ndiverse format options.

This highlights the\nimportance of integrated content-format optimization and offers a practical,\nmodel-agnostic approach to enhancing LLM performance.

      "summary": "This paper presents a method that allows users to design cinematic video\nshots in the context of image-to-video generation. Shot design, a critical\naspect of filmmaking, involves meticulously planning both camera movements and\nobject motions in a scene. However, enabling intuitive shot design in modern\nimage-to-video generation systems presents two main challenges: first,\neffectively capturing user intentions on the motion design, where both camera\nmovements and scene-space object motions must be specified jointly; and second,\nrepresenting motion information that can be effectively utilized by a video\ndiffusion model to synthesize the image animations. To address these\nchallenges, we introduce MotionCanvas, a method that integrates user-driven\ncontrols into image-to-video (I2V) generation models, allowing users to control\nboth object and camera motions in a scene-aware manner. By connecting insights\nfrom classical computer graphics and contemporary video generation techniques,\nwe demonstrate the ability to achieve 3D-aware motion control in I2V synthesis\nwithout requiring costly 3D-related training data. MotionCanvas enables users\nto intuitively depict scene-space motion intentions, and translates them into\nspatiotemporal motion-conditioning signals for video diffusion models. We\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our method on a wide range of real-world image\ncontent and shot-design scenarios, highlighting its potential to enhance the\ncreative workflows in digital content creation and adapt to various image and\nvideo editing applications.",

      "summary": "As Language Model (LM) capabilities advance, evaluating and supervising them\nat scale is getting harder for humans. There is hope that other language models\ncan automate both these tasks, which we refer to as \"AI Oversight\". We study\nhow model similarity affects both aspects of AI oversight by proposing a\nprobabilistic metric for LM similarity based on overlap in model mistakes.\nUsing this metric, we first show that LLM-as-a-judge scores favor models\nsimilar to the judge, generalizing recent self-preference results. Then, we\nstudy training on LM annotations, and find complementary knowledge between the\nweak supervisor and strong student model plays a crucial role in gains from\n\"weak-to-strong generalization\". As model capabilities increase, it becomes\nharder to find their mistakes, and we might defer more to AI oversight.\nHowever, we observe a concerning trend -- model mistakes are becoming more\nsimilar with increasing capabilities, pointing to risks from correlated\nfailures. Our work underscores the importance of reporting and correcting for\nmodel similarity, especially in the emerging paradigm of AI oversight.",

      "summary": "Despite extensive safety alignment efforts, large language models (LLMs)\nremain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks that elicit harmful behavior. While\nexisting studies predominantly focus on attack methods that require technical\nexpertise, two critical questions remain underexplored: (1) Are jailbroken\nresponses truly useful in enabling average users to carry out harmful actions?\n(2) Do safety vulnerabilities exist in more common, simple human-LLM\ninteractions? In this paper, we demonstrate that LLM responses most effectively\nfacilitate harmful actions when they are both actionable and informative--two\nattributes easily elicited in multi-step, multilingual interactions. Using this\ninsight, we propose HarmScore, a jailbreak metric that measures how effectively\nan LLM response enables harmful actions, and Speak Easy, a simple multi-step,\nmultilingual attack framework. Notably, by incorporating Speak Easy into direct\nrequest and jailbreak baselines, we see an average absolute increase of 0.319\nin Attack Success Rate and 0.426 in HarmScore in both open-source and\nproprietary LLMs across four safety benchmarks. Our work reveals a critical yet\noften overlooked vulnerability: Malicious users can easily exploit common\ninteraction patterns for harmful intentions.",

While model architectures continue to evolve,\nthe natural language data struggles to scale up. To tackle this bottleneck, we\npropose MAssive Genre-Audience~(MAGA) reformulation\nmethod, which systematic synthesizes diverse, contextually-rich pretraining\ndata from existing corpus. This work makes three main contributions: (1) We\npropose MAGA reformulation method, a lightweight and scalable approach for\npretraining corpus expansion, and build a 770B tokens MAGACorpus. (2) We\nevaluate MAGACorpus with different data budget scaling strategies,\ndemonstrating consistent improvements across various model sizes (134M-13B),\nestablishing the necessity for next-generation large-scale synthetic\npretraining language models. (3) Through comprehensive analysis, we investigate\nprompt engineering's impact on synthetic training collapse and reveal\nlimitations in conventional collapse detection metrics using validation losses.\nOur work shows that MAGA can substantially expand training datasets while\nmaintaining quality, offering a reliably pathway for scaling models beyond data\nlimitations.",

To achieve this, we augment 2D videos with 3D\npoint trajectories and align them in pixel space.

Building on this, we\nregularize the shape and motion of objects in the video to eliminate undesired\nartifacts, \\eg, nonphysical deformation. Consequently, we enhance the quality\nof generated RGB videos and alleviate common issues like object morphing, which\nare prevalent in current video models due to a lack of shape awareness. With\nour 3D augmentation and regularization, our model is capable of handling\ncontact-rich scenarios such as task-oriented videos. These videos involve\ncomplex interactions of solids, where 3D information is essential for\nperceiving deformation and contact. Furthermore, our model improves the overall\nquality of video generation by promoting the 3D consistency of moving objects\nand reducing abrupt changes in shape and motion.",

      "summary": "We propose Heterogeneous Masked Autoregression (HMA) for modeling\naction-video dynamics to generate high-quality data and evaluation in scaling\nrobot learning. Building interactive video world models and policies for\nrobotics is difficult due to the challenge of handling diverse settings while\nmaintaining computational efficiency to run in real time. HMA uses\nheterogeneous pre-training from observations and action sequences across\ndifferent robotic embodiments, domains, and tasks. HMA uses masked\nautoregression to generate quantized or soft tokens for video predictions.\n\\ourshort achieves better visual fidelity and controllability than the previous\nrobotic video generation models with 15 times faster speed in the real world.\nAfter post-training, this model can be used as a video simulator from low-level\naction inputs for evaluating policies and generating synthetic data. See this\nlink https://liruiw.github.io/hma for more information.",
