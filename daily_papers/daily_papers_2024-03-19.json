Distillation methods, like the\nrecently introduced adversarial diffusion distillation (ADD) aim to shift the\nmodel from many-shot to single-step inference, albeit at the cost of expensive\nand difficult optimization due to its reliance on a fixed pretrained DINOv2\ndiscriminator. We introduce Latent Adversarial Diffusion Distillation (LADD), a\nnovel distillation approach overcoming the limitations of ADD. In contrast to\npixel-based ADD, LADD utilizes generative features from pretrained latent\ndiffusion models. This approach simplifies training and enhances performance,\nenabling high-resolution multi-aspect ratio image synthesis. We apply LADD to\nStable Diffusion 3 (8B) to obtain SD3-Turbo, a fast model that matches the\nperformance of state-of-the-art text-to-image generators using only four\nunguided sampling steps. Moreover, we systematically investigate its scaling\nbehavior and demonstrate LADD's effectiveness in various applications such as\nimage editing and inpainting.","upvotes":32},"publishedAt":"2024-03-19T03:16:09.386Z","title":"Fast High-Resolution Image Synthesis with Latent Adversarial Diffusion Distillation","mediaUrl":"https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2403.12015.png","numComments":0},{"paper":{"id":"2403.10704","authors":[{"_id":"65f91d16ea2d72e3b584f191","name":"Hakim Sidahmed","hidden":false},{"_id":"65f91d16ea2d72e3b584f192","user":{"avatarUrl":"/avatars/66b61203f2a6fd07f9026ba97f9e8c5d.svg","isPro":false,"fullname":"Samrat Phatale","user":"samratph","type":"user"},"name":"Samrat Phatale","status":"admin_assigned","statusLastChangedAt":"2024-03-19T09:30:47.424Z","hidden":false},{"_id":"65f91d16ea2d72e3b584f193","user":{"avatarUrl":"/avatars/35e63bfd293ee4a31f4057122c403ed0.svg","isPro":false,"fullname":"alexhutcheson","user":"alexhutcheson","type":"user"},"name":"Alex Hutcheson","status":"admin_assigned","statusLastChangedAt":"2024-03-19T09:30:53.475Z","hidden":false},{"_id":"65f91d16ea2d72e3b584f194","name":"Zhuonan Lin","hidden":false},{"_id":"65f91d16ea2d72e3b584f195","name":"Zhang Chen","hidden":false},{"_id":"65f91d16ea2d72e3b584f196","user":{"avatarUrl":"/avatars/fc9d7825e5f108f0ec231c9f4d1caeb6.svg","isPro":false,"fullname":"zac yu","user":"zacyy","type":"user"},"name":"Zac Yu","status":"admin_assigned","statusLastChangedAt":"2024-03-19T09:31:43.363Z","hidden":false},{"_id":"65f91d16ea2d72e3b584f197","name":"Jarvis Jin","hidden":false},{"_id":"65f91d16ea2d72e3b584f198","name":"Roman Komarytsia","hidden":false},{"_id":"65f91d16ea2d72e3b584f199","name":"Christiane Ahlheim","hidden":false},{"_id":"65f91d16ea2d72e3b584f19a","name":"Yonghao Zhu","hidden":false},{"_id":"65f91d16ea2d72e3b584f19b","name":"Simral Chaudhary","hidden":false},{"_id":"65f91d16ea2d72e3b584f19c","name":"Bowen Li","hidden":false},{"_id":"65f91d16ea2d72e3b584f19d","user":{"avatarUrl":"/avatars/df47f880b3d7c824b1a616c39ebdfb1c.svg","isPro":false,"fullname":"Saravanan Ganesh","user":"srrvnn","type":"user"},"name":"Saravanan Ganesh","status":"admin_assigned","statusLastChangedAt":"2024-03-19T09:32:51.302Z","hidden":false},{"_id":"65f91d16ea2d72e3b584f19e","name":"Bill Byrne","hidden":false},{"_id":"65f91d16ea2d72e3b584f19f","user":{"avatarUrl":"/avatars/dafe1e85f3d97ab9acd5547fd2919ba9.svg","isPro":false,"fullname":"Jessica Hoffmann","user":"jessicahoffmann111","type":"user"},"name":"Jessica Hoffmann","status":"admin_assigned","statusLastChangedAt":"2024-03-19T09:33:03.861Z","hidden":false},{"_id":"65f91d16ea2d72e3b584f1a0","user":{"avatarUrl":"/avatars/e45f3ee28bff3571f76caf847d3c36db.svg","isPro":false,"fullname":"Hassan Mansoor","user":"HassanMansoor","type":"user"},"name":"Hassan Mansoor","status":"admin_assigned","statusLastChangedAt":"2024-03-19T09:33:09.298Z","hidden":false},{"_id":"65f91d16ea2d72e3b584f1a1","name":"Wei Li","hidden":false},{"_id":"65f91d16ea2d72e3b584f1a2","name":"Abhinav Rastogi","hidden":false},{"_id":"65f91d16ea2d72e3b584f1a3","user":{"avatarUrl":"/avatars/640a06bb5767daa6d17f9ee000bb8900.svg","isPro":false,"fullname":"Lucas Dixon","user":"iislucas","type":"user"},"name":"Lucas Dixon","status":"admin_assigned","statusLastChangedAt":"2024-03-19T09:33:50.021Z","hidden":false}],"publishedAt":"2024-03-15T21:43:46.000Z","title":"PERL: Parameter Efficient Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback","summary":"Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has proven to be a strong\nmethod to align Pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences.\nBut training models with RLHF is computationally expensive, and an overall\ncomplex process.

This paper proposes MVEdit, which\nfunctions as a 3D counterpart of SDEdit, employing ancestral sampling to\njointly denoise multi-view images and output high-quality textured meshes.\nBuilt on off-the-shelf 2D diffusion models, MVEdit achieves 3D consistency\nthrough a training-free 3D Adapter, which lifts the 2D views of the last\ntimestep into a coherent 3D representation, then conditions the 2D views of the\nnext timestep using rendered views, without uncompromising visual quality. With\nan inference time of only 2-5 minutes, this framework achieves better trade-off\nbetween quality and speed than score distillation. MVEdit is highly versatile\nand extendable, with a wide range of applications including text/image-to-3D\ngeneration, 3D-to-3D editing, and high-quality texture synthesis. In\nparticular, evaluations demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in both\nimage-to-3D and text-guided texture generation tasks.

To tackle this challenge, we propose Infinite-ID, an\nID-semantics decoupling paradigm for identity-preserved personalization.\nSpecifically, we introduce identity-enhanced training, incorporating an\nadditional image cross-attention module to capture sufficient ID information\nwhile deactivating the original text cross-attention module of the diffusion\nmodel. This ensures that the image stream faithfully represents the identity\nprovided by the reference image while mitigating interference from textual\ninput. Additionally, we introduce a feature interaction mechanism that combines\na mixed attention module with an AdaIN-mean operation to seamlessly merge the\ntwo streams. This mechanism not only enhances the fidelity of identity and\nsemantic consistency but also enables convenient control over the styles of the\ngenerated images.
