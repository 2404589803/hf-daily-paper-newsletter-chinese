Existing Multimodal\nLarge Language Models (MLLMs) for Visual Document Understanding are equipped\nwith text recognition ability but lack general structure understanding\nabilities for text-rich document images. In this work, we emphasize the\nimportance of structure information in Visual Document Understanding and\npropose the Unified Structure Learning to boost the performance of MLLMs. Our\nUnified Structure Learning comprises structure-aware parsing tasks and\nmulti-grained text localization tasks across 5 domains: document, webpage,\ntable, chart, and natural image. To better encode structure information, we\ndesign a simple and effective vision-to-text module H-Reducer, which can not\nonly maintain the layout information but also reduce the length of visual\nfeatures by merging horizontal adjacent patches through convolution, enabling\nthe LLM to understand high-resolution images more efficiently. Furthermore, by\nconstructing structure-aware text sequences and multi-grained pairs of texts\nand bounding boxes for publicly available text-rich images, we build a\ncomprehensive training set DocStruct4M to support structure learning. Finally,\nwe construct a small but high-quality reasoning tuning dataset DocReason25K to\ntrigger the detailed explanation ability in the document domain.

However, most existing methods for\nproducing label taxonomies and building text-based label classifiers still rely\nheavily on domain expertise and manual curation, making the process expensive\nand time-consuming. This is particularly challenging when the label space is\nunder-specified and large-scale data annotations are unavailable. In this\npaper, we address these challenges with Large Language Models (LLMs), whose\nprompt-based interface facilitates the induction and use of large-scale pseudo\nlabels. We propose TnT-LLM, a two-phase framework that employs LLMs to automate\nthe process of end-to-end label generation and assignment with minimal human\neffort for any given use-case. In the first phase, we introduce a zero-shot,\nmulti-stage reasoning approach which enables LLMs to produce and refine a label\ntaxonomy iteratively. In the second phase, LLMs are used as data labelers that\nyield training samples so that lightweight supervised classifiers can be\nreliably built, deployed, and served at scale. We apply TnT-LLM to the analysis\nof user intent and conversational domain for Bing Copilot (formerly Bing Chat),\nan open-domain chat-based search engine. Extensive experiments using both human\nand automatic evaluation metrics demonstrate that TnT-LLM generates more\naccurate and relevant label taxonomies when compared against state-of-the-art\nbaselines, and achieves a favorable balance between accuracy and efficiency for\nclassification at scale.

Considering the redundancy in natural\nlanguage, existing approaches compress prompts by removing tokens or lexical\nunits according to their information entropy obtained from a causal language\nmodel such as LLaMa-7B. The challenge is that information entropy may be a\nsuboptimal compression metric: (i) it only leverages unidirectional context and\nmay fail to capture all essential information needed for prompt compression;\n(ii) it is not aligned with the prompt compression objective.\n  To address these issues, we propose a data distillation procedure to derive\nknowledge from an LLM to compress prompts without losing crucial information,\nand meantime, introduce an extractive text compression dataset. We formulate\nprompt compression as a token classification problem to guarantee the\nfaithfulness of the compressed prompt to the original one, and use a\nTransformer encoder as the base architecture to capture all essential\ninformation for prompt compression from the full bidirectional context.

To address these shortcomings, this paper introduces a\nnovel diffusion-based framework, GVGEN, designed to efficiently generate 3D\nGaussian representations from text input. We propose two innovative\ntechniques:(1) Structured Volumetric Representation. We first arrange\ndisorganized 3D Gaussian points as a structured form GaussianVolume. This\ntransformation allows the capture of intricate texture details within a volume\ncomposed of a fixed number of Gaussians. To better optimize the representation\nof these details, we propose a unique pruning and densifying method named the\nCandidate Pool Strategy, enhancing detail fidelity through selective\noptimization. (2) Coarse-to-fine Generation Pipeline. To simplify the\ngeneration of GaussianVolume and empower the model to generate instances with\ndetailed 3D geometry, we propose a coarse-to-fine pipeline. It initially\nconstructs a basic geometric structure, followed by the prediction of complete\nGaussian attributes. Our framework, GVGEN, demonstrates superior performance in\nqualitative and quantitative assessments compared to existing 3D generation\nmethods. Simultaneously, it maintains a fast generation speed (sim7\nseconds), effectively striking a balance between quality and efficiency.","upvotes":4},"publishedAt":"2024-03-20T03:12:02.029Z","title":"GVGEN: Text-to-3D Generation with Volumetric Representation","mediaUrl":"https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2403.12957.png","numComments":0},{"paper":{"id":"2403.12962","authors":[{"_id":"65fa679becb85d8ad7e030c2","name":"Shuai Yang","hidden":false},{"_id":"65fa679becb85d8ad7e030c3","name":"Yifan Zhou","hidden":false},{"_id":"65fa679becb85d8ad7e030c4","name":"Ziwei Liu","hidden":false},{"_id":"65fa679becb85d8ad7e030c5","name":"Chen Change Loy","hidden":false}],"publishedAt":"2024-03-19T17:59:18.000Z","title":"FRESCO: Spatial-Temporal Correspondence for Zero-Shot Video Translation","summary":"The remarkable efficacy of text-to-image diffusion models has motivated\nextensive exploration of their potential application in video domains.\nZero-shot methods seek to extend image diffusion models to videos without\nnecessitating model training. Recent methods mainly focus on incorporating\ninter-frame correspondence into attention mechanisms. However, the soft\nconstraint imposed on determining where to attend to valid features can\nsometimes be insufficient, resulting in temporal inconsistency. In this paper,\nwe introduce FRESCO, intra-frame correspondence alongside inter-frame\ncorrespondence to establish a more robust spatial-temporal constraint. This\nenhancement ensures a more consistent transformation of semantically similar\ncontent across frames. Beyond mere attention guidance, our approach involves an\nexplicit update of features to achieve high spatial-temporal consistency with\nthe input video, significantly improving the visual coherence of the resulting\ntranslated videos.
