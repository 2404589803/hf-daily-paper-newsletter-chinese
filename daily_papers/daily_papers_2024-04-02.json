Language Model Red-teamed\n  according to the U.S. Executive Order","summary":"Pretrained language models underpin several AI applications, but their high\ncomputational cost for training limits accessibility. Initiatives such as BLOOM\nand StarCoder aim to democratize access to pretrained models for collaborative\ncommunity development. However, such existing models face challenges: limited\nmultilingual capabilities, continual pretraining causing catastrophic\nforgetting, whereas pretraining from scratch is computationally expensive, and\ncompliance with AI safety and development laws. This paper presents Aurora-M, a\n15B parameter multilingual open-source model trained on English, Finnish,\nHindi, Japanese, Vietnamese, and code. Continually pretrained from\nStarCoderPlus on 435 billion additional tokens, Aurora-M surpasses 2 trillion\ntokens in total training token count. It is the first open-source multilingual\nmodel fine-tuned on human-reviewed safety instructions, thus aligning its\ndevelopment not only with conventional red-teaming considerations, but also\nwith the specific concerns articulated in the Biden-Harris Executive Order on\nthe Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial\nIntelligence. Aurora-M is rigorously evaluated across various tasks and\nlanguages, demonstrating robustness against catastrophic forgetting and\noutperforming alternatives in multilingual settings, particularly in safety\nevaluations.

In this paper, we offer a\ncomprehensive investigation of this limitation, while also developing datasets\nand methods that achieve state-of-the-art performance. First, we find that\ncurrent vision-language datasets do not represent spatial relationships well\nenough; to alleviate this bottleneck, we create SPRIGHT, the first\nspatially-focused, large scale dataset, by re-captioning 6 million images from\n4 widely used vision datasets. Through a 3-fold evaluation and analysis\npipeline, we find that SPRIGHT largely improves upon existing datasets in\ncapturing spatial relationships. To demonstrate its efficacy, we leverage only\n~0.25% of SPRIGHT and achieve a 22% improvement in generating spatially\naccurate images while also improving the FID and CMMD scores. Secondly, we find\nthat training on images containing a large number of objects results in\nsubstantial improvements in spatial consistency. Notably, we attain\nstate-of-the-art on T2I-CompBench with a spatial score of 0.2133, by\nfine-tuning on <500 images. Finally, through a set of controlled experiments\nand ablations, we document multiple findings that we believe will enhance the\nunderstanding of factors that affect spatial consistency in text-to-image\nmodels. We publicly release our dataset and model to foster further research in\nthis area.","upvotes":19},"publishedAt":"2024-04-02T05:41:30.111Z","title":"Getting it Right: Improving Spatial Consistency in Text-to-Image Models","mediaUrl":"https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2404.01197.png","numComments":0},{"paper":{"id":"2404.00987","authors":[{"_id":"660b96033fbd33a1d0f703dc","user":{"avatarUrl":"/avatars/3e9b158af52c5f738a3eae72dcbb3824.svg","isPro":false,"fullname":"Ruowen Zhao","user":"zzzrw","type":"user"},"name":"Ruowen Zhao","status":"claimed_verified","statusLastChangedAt":"2024-04-02T11:02:58.599Z","hidden":false},{"_id":"660b96033fbd33a1d0f703dd","name":"Zhengyi Wang","hidden":false},{"_id":"660b96033fbd33a1d0f703de","name":"Yikai Wang","hidden":false},{"_id":"660b96033fbd33a1d0f703df","name":"Zihan Zhou","hidden":false},{"_id":"660b96033fbd33a1d0f703e0","name":"Jun Zhu","hidden":false}],"publishedAt":"2024-04-01T08:20:18.000Z","title":"FlexiDreamer: Single Image-to-3D Generation with FlexiCubes","summary":"3D content generation from text prompts or single images has made remarkable\nprogress in quality and speed recently. One of its dominant paradigms involves\ngenerating consistent multi-view images followed by a sparse-view\nreconstruction. However, due to the challenge of directly deforming the mesh\nrepresentation to approach the target topology, most methodologies learn an\nimplicit representation (such as NeRF) during the sparse-view reconstruction\nand acquire the target mesh by a post-processing extraction. Although the\nimplicit representation can effectively model rich 3D information, its training\ntypically entails a long convergence time. In addition, the post-extraction\noperation from the implicit field also leads to undesirable visual artifacts.\nIn this paper, we propose FlexiDreamer, a novel single image-to-3d generation\nframework that reconstructs the target mesh in an end-to-end manner. By\nleveraging a flexible gradient-based extraction known as FlexiCubes, our method\ncircumvents the defects brought by the post-processing and facilitates a direct\nacquisition of the target mesh. Furthermore, we incorporate a multi-resolution\nhash grid encoding scheme that progressively activates the encoding levels into\nthe implicit field in FlexiCubes to help capture geometric details for per-step\noptimization.

However, effectively integrating\nlistening capabilities into LLMs poses significant challenges, particularly\nwith respect to generalizing across varied contexts and executing complex\nauditory tasks. In this work, we introduce WavLLM, a robust and adaptive speech\nlarge language model with dual encoders, and a prompt-aware LoRA weight\nadapter, optimized by a two-stage curriculum learning approach. Leveraging dual\nencoders, we decouple different types of speech information, utilizing a\nWhisper encoder to process the semantic content of speech, and a WavLM encoder\nto capture the unique characteristics of the speaker's identity. Within the\ncurriculum learning framework, WavLLM first builds its foundational\ncapabilities by optimizing on mixed elementary single tasks, followed by\nadvanced multi-task training on more complex tasks such as combinations of the\nelementary tasks. To enhance the flexibility and adherence to different tasks\nand instructions, a prompt-aware LoRA weight adapter is introduced in the\nsecond advanced multi-task training stage.

Unlike current general-purpose\nfoundation models that are stuck in the dilemma of inferior quality and\ntext-image misalignment for humans, CosmicMan enables generating\nphoto-realistic human images with meticulous appearance, reasonable structure,\nand precise text-image alignment with detailed dense descriptions. At the heart\nof CosmicMan's success are the new reflections and perspectives on data and\nmodels: (1) We found that data quality and a scalable data production flow are\nessential for the final results from trained models. Hence, we propose a new\ndata production paradigm, Annotate Anyone, which serves as a perpetual data\nflywheel to produce high-quality data with accurate yet cost-effective\nannotations over time. Based on this, we constructed a large-scale dataset,\nCosmicMan-HQ 1.0, with 6 Million high-quality real-world human images in a mean\nresolution of 1488x1255, and attached with precise text annotations deriving\nfrom 115 Million attributes in diverse granularities. (2) We argue that a\ntext-to-image foundation model specialized for humans must be pragmatic -- easy\nto integrate into down-streaming tasks while effective in producing\nhigh-quality human images. Hence, we propose to model the relationship between\ndense text descriptions and image pixels in a decomposed manner, and present\nDecomposed-Attention-Refocusing (Daring) training framework. It seamlessly\ndecomposes the cross-attention features in existing text-to-image diffusion\nmodel, and enforces attention refocusing without adding extra modules. Through\nDaring, we show that explicitly discretizing continuous text space into several\nbasic groups that align with human body structure is the key to tackling the\nmisalignment problem in a breeze.","upvotes":3},"publishedAt":"2024-04-02T14:55:59.608Z","title":"CosmicMan: A Text-to-Image Foundation Model for Humans","mediaUrl":"https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2404.01294.png","numComments":0},{"paper":{"id":"2404.01292","authors":[{"_id":"660c212e5c4bb2bcc485e41a","name":"Gowthami Somepalli","hidden":false},{"_id":"660c212e5c4bb2bcc485e41b","name":"Anubhav Gupta","hidden":false},{"_id":"660c212e5c4bb2bcc485e41c","name":"Kamal Gupta","hidden":false},{"_id":"660c212e5c4bb2bcc485e41d","name":"Shramay Palta","hidden":false},{"_id":"660c212e5c4bb2bcc485e41e","name":"Micah Goldblum","hidden":false},{"_id":"660c212e5c4bb2bcc485e41f","name":"Jonas Geiping","hidden":false},{"_id":"660c212e5c4bb2bcc485e420","name":"Abhinav Shrivastava","hidden":false},{"_id":"660c212e5c4bb2bcc485e421","name":"Tom Goldstein","hidden":false}],"publishedAt":"2024-04-01T17:58:30.000Z","title":"Measuring Style Similarity in Diffusion Models","summary":"Generative models are now widely used by graphic designers and artists.

This is an\nexpensive bottleneck in enterprise scenarios, where we want to train custom\nextractors for thousands of different document types in a scalable way.\nPre-training an extractor model on unlabeled instances of the target document\ntype, followed by a fine-tuning step on human-labeled instances does not work\nin these scenarios, as it surpasses the maximum allowable training time\nallocated for the extractor. We address this scenario by proposing a\nNoise-Aware Training method or NAT in this paper. Instead of acquiring\nexpensive human-labeled documents, NAT utilizes weakly labeled documents to\ntrain an extractor in a scalable way. To avoid degradation in the model's\nquality due to noisy, weakly labeled samples, NAT estimates the confidence of\neach training sample and incorporates it as uncertainty measure during\ntraining. We train multiple state-of-the-art extractor models using NAT.\nExperiments on a number of publicly available and in-house datasets show that\nNAT-trained models are not only robust in performance -- it outperforms a\ntransfer-learning baseline by up to 6% in terms of macro-F1 score, but it is\nalso more label-efficient -- it reduces the amount of human-effort required to\nobtain comparable performance by up to 73%.","upvotes":1},"publishedAt":"2024-04-02T15:42:28.141Z","title":"Noise-Aware Training of Layout-Aware Language Models","mediaUrl":"https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2404.00488.png","numComments":0},{"paper":{"id":"2404.00308","authors":[{"_id":"660c1ff5c1174469000169fa","name":"Ruyang Liu","hidden":false},{"_id":"660c1ff5c1174469000169fb","name":"Chen Li","hidden":false},{"_id":"660c1ff5c1174469000169fc","name":"Haoran Tang","hidden":false},{"_id":"660c1ff5c1174469000169fd","name":"Yixiao Ge","hidden":false},{"_id":"660c1ff5c1174469000169fe","name":"Ying Shan","hidden":false},{"_id":"660c1ff5c1174469000169ff","name":"Ge Li","hidden":false}],"publishedAt":"2024-03-30T10:11:26.000Z","title":"ST-LLM: Large Language Models Are Effective Temporal Learners","summary":"Large Language Models (LLMs) have showcased impressive capabilities in text\ncomprehension and generation, prompting research efforts towards video LLMs to\nfacilitate human-AI interaction at the video level.
