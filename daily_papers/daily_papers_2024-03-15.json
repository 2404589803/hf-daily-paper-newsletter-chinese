LLM Pre-training","summary":"In this work, we discuss building performant Multimodal Large Language Models\n(MLLMs). In particular, we study the importance of various architecture\ncomponents and data choices. Through careful and comprehensive ablations of the\nimage encoder, the vision language connector, and various pre-training data\nchoices, we identified several crucial design lessons. For example, we\ndemonstrate that for large-scale multimodal pre-training using a careful mix of\nimage-caption, interleaved image-text, and text-only data is crucial for\nachieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) few-shot results across multiple benchmarks,\ncompared to other published pre-training results. Further, we show that the\nimage encoder together with image resolution and the image token count has\nsubstantial impact, while the vision-language connector design is of\ncomparatively negligible importance. By scaling up the presented recipe, we\nbuild MM1, a family of multimodal models up to 30B parameters, consisting of\nboth dense models and mixture-of-experts (MoE) variants, that are SOTA in\npre-training metrics and achieve competitive performance after supervised\nfine-tuning on a range of established multimodal benchmarks. Thanks to\nlarge-scale pre-training, MM1 enjoys appealing properties such as enhanced\nin-context learning, and multi-image reasoning, enabling few-shot\nchain-of-thought prompting.","upvotes":39},"publishedAt":"2024-03-15T02:27:09.826Z","title":"MM1: Methods, Analysis & Insights from Multimodal LLM Pre-training","mediaUrl":"https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2403.09611.png","numComments":0},{"paper":{"id":"2403.09029","authors":[{"_id":"65f3a30e2b4e85e2e8898b2d","user":{"avatarUrl":"https://aeiljuispo.cloudimg.io/v7/https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/1635201569275-noauth.jpeg?w=200&h=200&f=face","isPro":false,"fullname":"Hugo Laurençon","user":"HugoLaurencon","type":"user"},"name":"Hugo Laurençon","status":"admin_assigned","statusLastChangedAt":"2024-03-15T08:42:49.912Z","hidden":false},{"_id":"65f3a30e2b4e85e2e8898b2e","user":{"avatarUrl":"https://aeiljuispo.cloudimg.io/v7/https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/1652185658647-6244866a456803e9500d0f6a.jpeg?w=200&h=200&f=face","isPro":false,"fullname":"Leo Tronchon","user":"Leyo","type":"user"},"name":"Léo Tronchon","status":"admin_assigned","statusLastChangedAt":"2024-03-15T08:43:01.647Z","hidden":false},{"_id":"65f3a30e2b4e85e2e8898b2f","user":{"avatarUrl":"https://aeiljuispo.cloudimg.io/v7/https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/1619623771844-5ecea265968f6028e0559fa5.jpeg?w=200&h=200&f=face","isPro":true,"fullname":"Victor Sanh","user":"VictorSanh","type":"user"},"name":"Victor Sanh","status":"admin_assigned","statusLastChangedAt":"2024-03-15T08:43:09.692Z","hidden":false}],"publishedAt":"2024-03-14T01:40:40.000Z","title":"Unlocking the conversion of Web Screenshots into HTML Code with the\n  WebSight Dataset","summary":"Using vision-language models (VLMs) in web development presents a promising\nstrategy to increase efficiency and unblock no-code solutions: by providing a\nscreenshot or a sketch of a UI, a VLM could generate the code to reproduce it,\nfor instance in a language like HTML.

Although\nreasoning-focused works have often framed reasoning as a method of answering\nquestions or completing agentic tasks, reasoning is implicit in almost all\nwritten text. For example, this applies to the steps not stated between the\nlines of a proof or to the theory of mind underlying a conversation. In the\nSelf-Taught Reasoner (STaR, Zelikman et al. 2022), useful thinking is learned\nby inferring rationales from few-shot examples in question-answering and\nlearning from those that lead to a correct answer. This is a highly constrained\nsetting -- ideally, a language model could instead learn to infer unstated\nrationales in arbitrary text. We present Quiet-STaR, a generalization of STaR\nin which LMs learn to generate rationales at each token to explain future text,\nimproving their predictions. We address key challenges, including 1) the\ncomputational cost of generating continuations, 2) the fact that the LM does\nnot initially know how to generate or use internal thoughts, and 3) the need to\npredict beyond individual next tokens. To resolve these, we propose a tokenwise\nparallel sampling algorithm, using learnable tokens indicating a thought's\nstart and end, and an extended teacher-forcing technique. Encouragingly,\ngenerated rationales disproportionately help model difficult-to-predict tokens\nand improve the LM's ability to directly answer difficult questions. In\nparticular, after continued pretraining of an LM on a corpus of internet text\nwith Quiet-STaR, we find zero-shot improvements on GSM8K\n(5.9%rightarrow10.9%) and CommonsenseQA (36.3%rightarrow47.2%) and\nobserve a perplexity improvement of difficult tokens in natural text.\nCrucially, these improvements require no fine-tuning on these tasks. Quiet-STaR\nmarks a step towards LMs that can learn to reason in a more general and\nscalable way.","upvotes":16},"publishedAt":"2024-03-15T03:51:23.092Z","title":"Quiet-STaR: Language Models Can Teach Themselves to Think Before Speaking","mediaUrl":"https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2403.09629.png","numComments":2},{"paper":{"id":"2403.09334","authors":[{"_id":"65f3b141d09b5f817d5d85a6","user":{"avatarUrl":"/avatars/a497669a4c53a724c4f6ea615d1dda59.svg","isPro":false,"fullname":"Uriel Singer","user":"urielsinger","type":"user"},"name":"Uriel Singer","status":"claimed_verified","statusLastChangedAt":"2024-03-15T08:03:13.077Z","hidden":false},{"_id":"65f3b141d09b5f817d5d85a7","user":{"avatarUrl":"/avatars/4ae9ffe5d494a7d53bc519ff8e402b3e.svg","isPro":false,"fullname":"Amit Zohar","user":"amitz","type":"user"},"name":"Amit Zohar","status":"admin_assigned","statusLastChangedAt":"2024-03-15T08:17:19.261Z","hidden":false},{"_id":"65f3b141d09b5f817d5d85a8","user":{"avatarUrl":"/avatars/0727b7175a077b28035732352f5be171.svg","isPro":false,"fullname":"Yuval Kirstain","user":"yuvalkirstain","type":"user"},"name":"Yuval Kirstain","status":"admin_assigned","statusLastChangedAt":"2024-03-15T08:17:25.887Z","hidden":false},{"_id":"65f3b141d09b5f817d5d85a9","user":{"avatarUrl":"https://aeiljuispo.cloudimg.io/v7/https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/1665662111525-63468e6ca6f101c7f9049132.png?w=200&h=200&f=face","isPro":false,"fullname":"Shelly Sheynin","user":"shellysheynin","type":"user"},"name":"Shelly Sheynin","status":"admin_assigned","statusLastChangedAt":"2024-03-15T08:17:33.313Z","hidden":false},{"_id":"65f3b141d09b5f817d5d85aa","user":{"avatarUrl":"/avatars/02a571bc791b78d3993d9a0484b70a29.svg","isPro":false,"fullname":"Adam Polyak","user":"adampo","type":"user"},"name":"Adam Polyak","status":"admin_assigned","statusLastChangedAt":"2024-03-15T08:17:40.192Z","hidden":false},{"_id":"65f3b141d09b5f817d5d85ab","user":{"avatarUrl":"/avatars/f793c00a98335cd8f7efce41d403da16.svg","isPro":false,"fullname":"Devi Parikh","user":"deviparikh-genai","type":"user"},"name":"Devi Parikh","status":"admin_assigned","statusLastChangedAt":"2024-03-15T08:17:48.027Z","hidden":false},{"_id":"65f3b141d09b5f817d5d85ac","name":"Yaniv Taigman","hidden":false}],"publishedAt":"2024-03-14T12:22:54.000Z","title":"Video Editing via Factorized Diffusion Distillation","summary":"We introduce Emu Video Edit (EVE), a model that establishes a new\nstate-of-the art in video editing without relying on any supervised video\nediting data.

However, unlike language\nmodeling, visual tasks typically require specific modules, such as bounding box\nheads for detection and pixel decoders for segmentation, greatly hindering the\napplication of powerful multi-layer transformers in the vision domain. To solve\nthis, we design a universal language interface that empowers the successful\nauto-regressive decoding to adeptly unify various visual tasks, from\nimage-level understanding (e.g., captioning), over sparse perception (e.g.,\ndetection), to dense prediction (e.g., segmentation). Based on the above\ndesigns, the entire model is composed solely of a ViT, without any specific\nadditions, offering a remarkable architectural simplification. GiT is a\nmulti-task visual model, jointly trained across five representative benchmarks\nwithout task-specific fine-tuning. Interestingly, our GiT builds a new\nbenchmark in generalist performance, and fosters mutual enhancement across\ntasks, leading to significant improvements compared to isolated training. This\nreflects a similar impact observed in LLMs. Further enriching training with 27\ndatasets, GiT achieves strong zero-shot results over various tasks.

These compelling outcomes aim to encourage further\nexploration in designing customized text encoders for diverse and challenging\ntasks.","upvotes":5},"publishedAt":"2024-03-15T02:36:13.062Z","title":"Glyph-ByT5: A Customized Text Encoder for Accurate Visual Text Rendering","mediaUrl":"https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2403.09622.png","numComments":0},{"paper":{"id":"2403.09631","authors":[{"_id":"65f3c9dc5f86a2581bcf2d37","user":{"avatarUrl":"https://aeiljuispo.cloudimg.io/v7/https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/6437c7dae282b4a48eaf065e/AxodKQXyrviTFQRyjnL01.jpeg?w=200&h=200&f=face","isPro":false,"fullname":"Haoyu Zhen","user":"anyeZHY","type":"user"},"name":"Haoyu Zhen","status":"admin_assigned","statusLastChangedAt":"2024-03-15T13:15:41.732Z","hidden":false},{"_id":"65f3c9dc5f86a2581bcf2d38","user":{"avatarUrl":"/avatars/9dc8451a7d33eb12ff80e70026558ec4.svg","isPro":false,"fullname":"Xiaowen Qiu","user":"miscalculation","type":"user"},"name":"Xiaowen Qiu","status":"admin_assigned","statusLastChangedAt":"2024-03-15T13:15:49.401Z","hidden":false},{"_id":"65f3c9dc5f86a2581bcf2d39","user":{"avatarUrl":"/avatars/a54ddb6d69a73f63f9d848f28abcbff3.svg","isPro":false,"fullname":"PeihaoChen","user":"PeihaoChen","type":"user"},"name":"Peihao Chen","status":"admin_assigned","statusLastChangedAt":"2024-03-15T13:17:11.437Z","hidden":false},{"_id":"65f3c9dc5f86a2581bcf2d3a","name":"Jincheng Yang","hidden":false},{"_id":"65f3c9dc5f86a2581bcf2d3b","user":{"avatarUrl":"https://aeiljuispo.cloudimg.io/v7/https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/62f1fcbee2c9b4f83b4a6276/Vb648pHEskN7U0rZouYha.jpeg?w=200&h=200&f=face","isPro":false,"fullname":"Xin Yan","user":"Cakeyan","type":"user"},"name":"Xin Yan","status":"claimed_verified","statusLastChangedAt":"2024-03-15T16:08:41.305Z","hidden":false},{"_id":"65f3c9dc5f86a2581bcf2d3c","user":{"avatarUrl":"/avatars/def472d1ab3fbf751225357c0932ae7e.svg","isPro":false,"fullname":"Yilun Du","user":"yilundu","type":"user"},"name":"Yilun Du","status":"admin_assigned","statusLastChangedAt":"2024-03-15T13:17:32.731Z","hidden":false},{"_id":"65f3c9dc5f86a2581bcf2d3d","user":{"avatarUrl":"/avatars/ea577762b6b4798f87a7a3f1d53d082c.svg","isPro":false,"fullname":"Yining Hong","user":"evelynhong","type":"user"},"name":"Yining Hong","status":"admin_assigned","statusLastChangedAt":"2024-03-15T13:17:39.270Z","hidden":false},{"_id":"65f3c9dc5f86a2581bcf2d3e","name":"Chuang Gan","hidden":false}],"publishedAt":"2024-03-14T17:58:41.000Z","title":"3D-VLA: A 3D Vision-Language-Action Generative World Model","summary":"Recent vision-language-action (VLA) models rely on 2D inputs, lacking\nintegration with the broader realm of the 3D physical world. Furthermore, they\nperform action prediction by learning a direct mapping from perception to\naction, neglecting the vast dynamics of the world and the relations between\nactions and dynamics. In contrast, human beings are endowed with world models\nthat depict imagination about future scenarios to plan actions accordingly. To\nthis end, we propose 3D-VLA by introducing a new family of embodied foundation\nmodels that seamlessly link 3D perception, reasoning, and action through a\ngenerative world model. Specifically, 3D-VLA is built on top of a 3D-based\nlarge language model (LLM), and a set of interaction tokens is introduced to\nengage with the embodied environment. Furthermore, to inject generation\nabilities into the model, we train a series of embodied diffusion models and\nalign them into the LLM for predicting the goal images and point clouds. To\ntrain our 3D-VLA, we curate a large-scale 3D embodied instruction dataset by\nextracting vast 3D-related information from existing robotics datasets. Our\nexperiments on held-in datasets demonstrate that 3D-VLA significantly improves\nthe reasoning, multimodal generation, and planning capabilities in embodied\nenvironments, showcasing its potential in real-world applications.","upvotes":4},"publishedAt":"2024-03-15T04:09:06.407Z","title":"3D-VLA: A 3D Vision-Language-Action Generative World Model","mediaUrl":"https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2403.09631.png","numComments":0}]
