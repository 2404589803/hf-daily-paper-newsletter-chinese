This trend involves either meticulously curating numerous instruction\ntuning datasets tailored to specific objectives or enlarging LLVMs to manage\nvast amounts of vision language (VL) data. However, current LLVMs have\ndisregarded the detailed and comprehensive real-world scene understanding\navailable from specialized computer vision (CV) models in visual perception\ntasks such as segmentation, detection, scene graph generation (SGG), and\noptical character recognition (OCR). Instead, the existing LLVMs rely mainly on\nthe large capacity and emergent capabilities of their LLM backbones. Therefore,\nwe present a new LLVM, Mixture of All Intelligence (MoAI), which leverages\nauxiliary visual information obtained from the outputs of external\nsegmentation, detection, SGG, and OCR models. MoAI operates through two newly\nintroduced modules: MoAI-Compressor and MoAI-Mixer. After verbalizing the\noutputs of the external CV models, the MoAI-Compressor aligns and condenses\nthem to efficiently use relevant auxiliary visual information for VL tasks.\nMoAI-Mixer then blends three types of intelligence (1) visual features, (2)\nauxiliary features from the external CV models, and (3) language features by\nutilizing the concept of Mixture of Experts. Through this integration, MoAI\nsignificantly outperforms both open-source and closed-source LLVMs in numerous\nzero-shot VL tasks, particularly those related to real-world scene\nunderstanding such as object existence, positions, relations, and OCR without\nenlarging the model size or curating extra visual instruction tuning datasets.","upvotes":29},"publishedAt":"2024-03-13T03:16:32.120Z","title":"MoAI: Mixture of All Intelligence for Large Language and Vision Models","mediaUrl":"https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2403.07508.png","numComments":0},{"paper":{"id":"2403.07816","authors":[{"_id":"65f114b632c29f9fb7031dfa","name":"Sainbayar Sukhbaatar","hidden":false},{"_id":"65f114b632c29f9fb7031dfb","user":{"avatarUrl":"/avatars/74325f5705ef46691462c8d8d457a0aa.svg","isPro":false,"fullname":"Olga Golovneva","user":"Golovneva","type":"user"},"name":"Olga Golovneva","status":"admin_assigned","statusLastChangedAt":"2024-03-13T13:32:59.410Z","hidden":false},{"_id":"65f114b632c29f9fb7031dfc","user":{"avatarUrl":"/avatars/fc62605bdf10947dab393305c51ace96.svg","isPro":false,"fullname":"Vasu Sharma","user":"vasusharma55","type":"user"},"name":"Vasu Sharma","status":"admin_assigned","statusLastChangedAt":"2024-03-13T13:33:23.695Z","hidden":false},{"_id":"65f114b632c29f9fb7031dfd","name":"Hu Xu","hidden":false},{"_id":"65f114b632c29f9fb7031dfe","user":{"avatarUrl":"/avatars/9dd7776d3b610d78e40c2e178ab2f112.svg","isPro":false,"fullname":"Victoria Lin","user":"VictoriaLinML","type":"user"},"name":"Xi Victoria Lin","status":"admin_assigned","statusLastChangedAt":"2024-03-13T13:34:11.498Z","hidden":false},{"_id":"65f114b632c29f9fb7031dff","user":{"avatarUrl":"/avatars/de0fc34bad8c761210c0895ebfa4feba.svg","isPro":false,"fullname":"Baptiste Roziere","user":"broz","type":"user"},"name":"Baptiste Rozi√®re","status":"admin_assigned","statusLastChangedAt":"2024-03-13T13:34:21.092Z","hidden":false},{"_id":"65f114b632c29f9fb7031e00","name":"Jacob Kahn","hidden":false},{"_id":"65f114b632c29f9fb7031e01","name":"Daniel Li","hidden":false},{"_id":"65f114b632c29f9fb7031e02","name":"Wen-tau Yih","hidden":false},{"_id":"65f114b632c29f9fb7031e03","user":{"avatarUrl":"/avatars/8ac1c5c74d0957e3c6cc94b3a7795c37.svg","isPro":false,"fullname":"Jason Weston","user":"spermwhale","type":"user"},"name":"Jason Weston","status":"admin_assigned","statusLastChangedAt":"2024-03-13T13:34:53.258Z","hidden":false},{"_id":"65f114b632c29f9fb7031e04","name":"Xian Li","hidden":false}],"publishedAt":"2024-03-12T16:54:58.000Z","title":"Branch-Train-MiX: Mixing Expert LLMs into a Mixture-of-Experts LLM","summary":"We investigate efficient methods for training Large Language Models (LLMs) to\npossess capabilities in multiple specialized domains, such as coding, math\nreasoning and world knowledge.

Second, FAX provides a full implementation of federated automatic\ndifferentiation, greatly simplifying the expression of federated computations.\nLast, FAX computations can be interpreted out to existing production\ncross-device federated compute systems. We show that FAX provides an easily\nprogrammable, performant, and scalable framework for federated computations in\nthe data center. FAX is available at\nhttps://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/fax .","upvotes":5},"publishedAt":"2024-03-13T03:03:49.933Z","title":"FAX: Scalable and Differentiable Federated Primitives in JAX","mediaUrl":"https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2403.07128.png","numComments":0},{"paper":{"id":"2403.07563","authors":[{"_id":"65f11bae6750342ce0915664","name":"Ri-Zhao Qiu","hidden":false},{"_id":"65f11bae6750342ce0915665","user":{"avatarUrl":"/avatars/7de71ca0c1b6711f4245fa75a0886225.svg","isPro":false,"fullname":"Yafei Hu","user":"jeffreyhu","type":"user"},"name":"Yafei Hu","status":"claimed_verified","statusLastChangedAt":"2024-03-13T13:26:27.653Z","hidden":false},{"_id":"65f11bae6750342ce0915666","user":{"avatarUrl":"https://aeiljuispo.cloudimg.io/v7/https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/1594093169905-noauth.jpeg?w=200&h=200&f=face","isPro":false,"fullname":"Ge Yang","user":"geyang","type":"user"},"name":"Ge Yang","status":"admin_assigned","statusLastChangedAt":"2024-03-13T13:59:01.984Z","hidden":false},{"_id":"65f11bae6750342ce0915667","name":"Yuchen Song","hidden":false},{"_id":"65f11bae6750342ce0915668","user":{"avatarUrl":"/avatars/db85a28500554c1989b5f744bcd8b220.svg","isPro":false,"fullname":"Yang Fu","user":"yangfu2","type":"user"},"name":"Yang Fu","status":"admin_assigned","statusLastChangedAt":"2024-03-13T13:59:46.939Z","hidden":false},{"_id":"65f11bae6750342ce0915669","user":{"avatarUrl":"https://aeiljuispo.cloudimg.io/v7/https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/1674216878324-634e2696d00bb5d92c3f4e86.jpeg?w=200&h=200&f=face","isPro":false,"fullname":"Jianglong Ye","user":"jianglongye","type":"user"},"name":"Jianglong Ye","status":"admin_assigned","statusLastChangedAt":"2024-03-13T13:59:53.438Z","hidden":false},{"_id":"65f11bae6750342ce091566a","user":{"avatarUrl":"/avatars/e1f7a90fad8792e2eb8d88ef03cea826.svg","isPro":false,"fullname":"JitengMu","user":"JitengMu","type":"user"},"name":"Jiteng Mu","status":"admin_assigned","statusLastChangedAt":"2024-03-13T14:00:10.024Z","hidden":false},{"_id":"65f11bae6750342ce091566b","name":"Ruihan Yang","hidden":false},{"_id":"65f11bae6750342ce091566c","name":"Nikolay Atanasov","hidden":false},{"_id":"65f11bae6750342ce091566d","name":"Sebastian Scherer","hidden":false},{"_id":"65f11bae6750342ce091566e","name":"Xiaolong Wang","hidden":false}],"publishedAt":"2024-03-12T11:51:55.000Z","title":"Learning Generalizable Feature Fields for Mobile Manipulation","summary":"An open problem in mobile manipulation is how to represent objects and scenes\nin a unified manner, so that robots can use it both for navigating in the\nenvironment and manipulating objects. The latter requires capturing intricate\ngeometry while understanding fine-grained semantics, whereas the former\ninvolves capturing the complexity inherit to an expansive physical scale. In\nthis work, we present GeFF (Generalizable Feature Fields), a scene-level\ngeneralizable neural feature field that acts as a unified representation for\nboth navigation and manipulation that performs in real-time. To do so, we treat\ngenerative novel view synthesis as a pre-training task, and then align the\nresulting rich scene priors with natural language via CLIP feature\ndistillation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach by deploying\nGeFF on a quadrupedal robot equipped with a manipulator. We evaluate GeFF's\nability to generalize to open-set objects as well as running time, when\nperforming open-vocabulary mobile manipulation in dynamic scenes.","upvotes":4},"publishedAt":"2024-03-13T03:21:20.631Z","title":"Learning Generalizable Feature Fields for Mobile Manipulation","mediaUrl":"https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2403.07563.png","numComments":0}]
