Since its launch by OpenAI in February\n2024, no other video generation models have paralleled {Sora}'s performance or\nits capacity to support a broad spectrum of video generation tasks.\nAdditionally, there are only a few fully published video generation models,\nwith the majority being closed-source. To address this gap, this paper proposes\na new multi-agent framework Mora, which incorporates several advanced visual AI\nagents to replicate generalist video generation demonstrated by Sora. In\nparticular, Mora can utilize multiple visual agents and successfully mimic\nSora's video generation capabilities in various tasks, such as (1)\ntext-to-video generation, (2) text-conditional image-to-video generation, (3)\nextend generated videos, (4) video-to-video editing, (5) connect videos and (6)\nsimulate digital worlds. Our extensive experimental results show that Mora\nachieves performance that is proximate to that of Sora in various tasks.\nHowever, there exists an obvious performance gap between our work and Sora when\nassessed holistically.

While model merging has emerged as a\npromising approach for LLM development due to its cost-effectiveness, it\ncurrently relies on human intuition and domain knowledge, limiting its\npotential. Here, we propose an evolutionary approach that overcomes this\nlimitation by automatically discovering effective combinations of diverse\nopen-source models, harnessing their collective intelligence without requiring\nextensive additional training data or compute. Our approach operates in both\nparameter space and data flow space, allowing for optimization beyond just the\nweights of the individual models. This approach even facilitates cross-domain\nmerging, generating models like a Japanese LLM with Math reasoning\ncapabilities. Surprisingly, our Japanese Math LLM achieved state-of-the-art\nperformance on a variety of established Japanese LLM benchmarks, even\nsurpassing models with significantly more parameters, despite not being\nexplicitly trained for such tasks. Furthermore, a culturally-aware Japanese VLM\ngenerated through our approach demonstrates its effectiveness in describing\nJapanese culture-specific content, outperforming previous Japanese VLMs. This\nwork not only contributes new state-of-the-art models back to the open-source\ncommunity, but also introduces a new paradigm for automated model composition,\npaving the way for exploring alternative, efficient approaches to foundation\nmodel development.","upvotes":24},"publishedAt":"2024-03-21T04:53:31.185Z","title":"Evolutionary Optimization of Model Merging Recipes","mediaUrl":"https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2403.13187.png","numComments":2},{"paper":{"id":"2403.13064","authors":[{"_id":"65fb9f77769c433dc27c3f65","name":"Armen Avetisyan","hidden":false},{"_id":"65fb9f77769c433dc27c3f66","name":"Christopher Xie","hidden":false},{"_id":"65fb9f77769c433dc27c3f67","user":{"avatarUrl":"/avatars/ffc07be80323aa4b7dadf8849b70ffde.svg","isPro":false,"fullname":"Henry Howard-Jenkins","user":"henryhj","type":"user"},"name":"Henry Howard-Jenkins","status":"admin_assigned","statusLastChangedAt":"2024-03-21T09:13:04.363Z","hidden":false},{"_id":"65fb9f77769c433dc27c3f68","user":{"avatarUrl":"/avatars/5aa9abe4fda94e65452c67b28060d169.svg","isPro":false,"fullname":"Tsun-Yi Yang","user":"shamangary","type":"user"},"name":"Tsun-Yi Yang","status":"admin_assigned","statusLastChangedAt":"2024-03-21T09:24:36.204Z","hidden":false},{"_id":"65fb9f77769c433dc27c3f69","name":"Samir Aroudj","hidden":false},{"_id":"65fb9f77769c433dc27c3f6a","user":{"avatarUrl":"/avatars/9d79cf64a10e4da3bc708c8f567d8349.svg","isPro":false,"fullname":"Suvam Patra","user":"Suvam","type":"user"},"name":"Suvam Patra","status":"admin_assigned","statusLastChangedAt":"2024-03-21T09:24:51.501Z","hidden":false},{"_id":"65fb9f77769c433dc27c3f6b","user":{"avatarUrl":"/avatars/1b33600d0e9be0d53fbb7e44a89c4710.svg","isPro":false,"fullname":"Fuyang Zhang","user":"zfy","type":"user"},"name":"Fuyang Zhang","status":"admin_assigned","statusLastChangedAt":"2024-03-21T09:24:59.402Z","hidden":false},{"_id":"65fb9f77769c433dc27c3f6c","user":{"avatarUrl":"/avatars/3d04d79721f4ec6b0b090e0bbbf85f70.svg","isPro":false,"fullname":"Duncan Frost","user":"frosd01","type":"user"},"name":"Duncan Frost","status":"claimed_verified","statusLastChangedAt":"2024-03-21T10:58:26.831Z","hidden":false},{"_id":"65fb9f77769c433dc27c3f6d","name":"Luke Holland","hidden":false},{"_id":"65fb9f77769c433dc27c3f6e","name":"Campbell Orme","hidden":false},{"_id":"65fb9f77769c433dc27c3f6f","name":"Jakob Engel","hidden":false},{"_id":"65fb9f77769c433dc27c3f70","name":"Edward Miller","hidden":false},{"_id":"65fb9f77769c433dc27c3f71","user":{"avatarUrl":"/avatars/245f849cde665f1d7dfec15dead6b880.svg","isPro":false,"fullname":"Richard Newcombe","user":"MONGIE30","type":"user"},"name":"Richard Newcombe","status":"admin_assigned","statusLastChangedAt":"2024-03-21T09:26:19.855Z","hidden":false},{"_id":"65fb9f77769c433dc27c3f72","name":"Vasileios Balntas","hidden":false}],"publishedAt":"2024-03-19T18:01:29.000Z","title":"SceneScript: Reconstructing Scenes With An Autoregressive Structured\n  Language Model","summary":"We introduce SceneScript, a method that directly produces full scene models\nas a sequence of structured language commands using an autoregressive,\ntoken-based approach.

They tend to synthesize quasi-static\nvideos, ignoring the necessary visual change-over-time implied in the text\nprompt. At the same time, scaling these models to enable longer, more dynamic\nvideo synthesis often remains computationally intractable. To address this\nchallenge, we introduce the concept of Generative Temporal Nursing (GTN), where\nwe aim to alter the generative process on the fly during inference to improve\ncontrol over the temporal dynamics and enable generation of longer videos. We\npropose a method for GTN, dubbed VSTAR, which consists of two key ingredients:\n1) Video Synopsis Prompting (VSP) - automatic generation of a video synopsis\nbased on the original single prompt leveraging LLMs, which gives accurate\ntextual guidance to different visual states of longer videos, and 2) Temporal\nAttention Regularization (TAR) - a regularization technique to refine the\ntemporal attention units of the pre-trained T2V diffusion models, which enables\ncontrol over the video dynamics. We experimentally showcase the superiority of\nthe proposed approach in generating longer, visually appealing videos over\nexisting open-sourced T2V models. We additionally analyze the temporal\nattention maps realized with and without VSTAR, demonstrating the importance of\napplying our method to mitigate neglect of the desired visual change over time.","upvotes":7},"publishedAt":"2024-03-21T04:18:13.538Z","title":"VSTAR: Generative Temporal Nursing for Longer Dynamic Video Synthesis","mediaUrl":"https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2403.13501.png","numComments":2},{"paper":{"id":"2403.13524","authors":[{"_id":"65fba5f7dfd0ff86aa77dd44","name":"Bowen Zhang","hidden":false},{"_id":"65fba5f7dfd0ff86aa77dd45","name":"Tianyu Yang","hidden":false},{"_id":"65fba5f7dfd0ff86aa77dd46","name":"Yu Li","hidden":false},{"_id":"65fba5f7dfd0ff86aa77dd47","name":"Lei Zhang","hidden":false},{"_id":"65fba5f7dfd0ff86aa77dd48","name":"Xi Zhao","hidden":false}],"publishedAt":"2024-03-20T11:51:04.000Z","title":"Compress3D: a Compressed Latent Space for 3D Generation from a Single\n  Image","summary":"3D generation has witnessed significant advancements, yet efficiently\nproducing high-quality 3D assets from a single image remains challenging. In\nthis paper, we present a triplane autoencoder, which encodes 3D models into a\ncompact triplane latent space to effectively compress both the 3D geometry and\ntexture information. Within the autoencoder framework, we introduce a 3D-aware\ncross-attention mechanism, which utilizes low-resolution latent representations\nto query features from a high-resolution 3D feature volume, thereby enhancing\nthe representation capacity of the latent space. Subsequently, we train a\ndiffusion model on this refined latent space. In contrast to solely relying on\nimage embedding for 3D generation, our proposed method advocates for the\nsimultaneous utilization of both image embedding and shape embedding as\nconditions. Specifically, the shape embedding is estimated via a diffusion\nprior model conditioned on the image embedding. Through comprehensive\nexperiments, we demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art\nalgorithms, achieving superior performance while requiring less training data\nand time.
